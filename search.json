an action.  Now let's use it.\n\nFirst, we check our routes:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nget '/dashboard', to: 'dashboard#index'\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nView Rendering\n    \nThen we edit the corresponding template:\n# apps/web/templates/dashboard/index.html.erb\n<h1>Dashboard</h1>\n\n\nHere is how Hanami handles an incoming request:\n\n\nThe router creates a new instance of Web::Controllers::Dashboard::Index and invokes #call.\nThe application creates a new instance of Web::Views::Dashboard::Index and invokes #render.\nThe application returns the response to the browser.\n\n\n\n  For a given action named Web::Controllers::Dashboard::Index, a corresponding view MUST be present: Web::Views::Dashboard::Index.\n\n\nIf we visit /dashboard we should see <h1>Dashboard</h1> in our browser.\n\n            \n      \n      \nBypass Rendering\n    \nBy default an action takes care of the HTTP status code and response header, but not of the body of the response.\nAs seen above, it delegates the corresponding view to render and set this value.\n\nSometimes we want to bypass this process.\nFor instance we want to return a simple body like OK.\nTo involve a view in this case is a waste of CPU cycles.\n\nIf we set the body of the response from an action, our application will ignore the view.\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      self.body = 'OK'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nHere is how Hanami handles an incoming request in this case:\n\n\nThe router creates a new instance of Web::Controllers::Dashboard::Index and invokes #call.\nThe application detects that a body is already set and doesn't instantiate the view.\nThe application returns the response to the browser.\n\n\nIf we visit /dashboard again, now we should see OK.\n\n\n  If the response body was already set by an action, the rendering process is bypassed.\n\n\nWith direct body assignment, we can safely delete the corresponding view and template.\n\n            \n      \n      \nInitialization\n    \nActions are instantiated for us by Hanami at the runtime: for each incoming request, we'll automatically get a new instance.\nBecause actions are objects, we can take control on their initialization and eventually inject our dependencies.\nThis is a really useful technique for unit testing our actions.\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def initialize(greeting: Greeting.new)\n      @greeting = greeting\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      self.body = @greeting.message\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThere is a limitation that we should always be kept in mind:\n\n\n  Action initializer MUST have an arity of 0.\n\n\nThe following initializers are valid:\n# no arguments\ndef initialize\n  # ...\nend\n\n# default arguments\ndef initialize(greeting = Greeting.new)\n  # ...\nend\n\n# keyword arguments\ndef initialize(greeting: Greeting.new)\n  # ...\nend\n\n# options\ndef initialize(options = {})\n  #

...\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nDon't use callbacks for model domain logic operations like sending emails.\nThis is an antipattern that causes a lot of problems for code maintenance, testability and accidental side effects.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nHalt\n    \nUsing exceptions for control flow is expensive for the Ruby VM.\nThere is a lightweight alternative that our language supports: signals (see throw and catch).\n\nHanami takes advantage of this mechanism to provide faster control flow in our actions via #halt.\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      halt 401 unless authenticated?\n      #

It also prevents gigantic controllers.\nIt has several advantages in terms of testability and control of an action.\n\n            \n      \n      \nA Simple Action\n    \nHanami ships with a generator for actions. Let's create a new one:\nhanami generate action web dashboard#index\n\n\nLet's examine the action:\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNaming\n    \nThat file begins with a module declaration.\n\nThe first token is the name of our application: Web.\nHanami can run multiple applications within the same Ruby process.\nThey are located under apps/.\nTheir name is used as a top-level module to contain inner components like actions and views, in order to avoid naming collisions.\nIf we have another action Home::Index under an application Admin, the two of them can coexist inside the same codebase.\n\nThe second token is a conventional name: Controllers.\nAll the controllers are nested under it.\nThis module is generated at runtime for us, when the application starts.\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, controllers are available under Web::Controllers.\n\n\nThe last bit is Dashboard, which is our controller.\n\nThe whole action name is Web::Controllers::Dashboard::Index.\n\n\n  You should avoid giving your action modules the same name as your application, e.g. avoid naming a controller Web in an app named Web. If you have a controller name like Web::Controllers::Web then some code across your app will break with errors about constants not being found, for example in views which include Web::Layout. This is because Ruby starts constant lookup with the current module, so a constant like Web::Layout referenced by code in the Web::Controllers::Web or Web::Controllers::Web::MyAction module will be converted to Web::Controllers::Web::Layout, which can't be found and causes a constant lookup error.\n\n\n\n  If you absolutely must name a controller with the same name as your application, you'll need to explicitly set the namespace lookup for things which should be included from immediately under the app, not the controller by prefixing those names with ::, e.g. change your views to include ::Web::Layout instead of include Web::Layout, and using include ::Web::Action in your controllers.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nÂ Action Module\n    \nHanami philosophy emphasizes composition over inheritance and avoids the framework superclass antipattern.\nFor this reason, all the components are provided as modules to include instead of base classes to inherit from.\n\nLike we said before, Hanami can run multiple apps within the same Ruby process.\nEach of them has its own configuration.\nTo keep separated actions from an application named Web and an application named Admin, we include Web::Action and Admin::Action respectively.\n\nIn our example, we have a directive include Web::Action.\nThat means our action will behave according to the configuration of the Web application.\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the action mixin to include is Web::Action.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nWhen we include Web::Action, we made our object compliant with Hanami::Controller's actions.\nWe need to implement #call, which is a method that accepts only one argument: params.\nThat is the object that carries the payload that comes from incoming HTTP requests from the router.\n\nThis interface reminds us of Rack.\nIndeed, our action is compatible with the Rack protocol.\n","url":"/guides/1.0/actions/overview/"},"96":{"title":"Guides - Action Parameters","content":"      \n      \n      \nParameters\n    \nParameters are taken from the Rack env and passed as an argument to #call.\nThey are similar to a Ruby Hash, but they offer an expanded set of features.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nParams can come from:\n\n\nRouter variables (eg. /books/:id)\nQuery string (eg. /books?title=Hanami)\nRequest body (eg. a POST request to /books)\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAccess\n    \nTo access the value of a param, we can use the subscriber operator #[].\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      self.body = \"Query string: #{ params[:q] }\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we visit /dashboard?q=foo, we should see Query string: foo.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSymbol Access\n    \nParams and nested params can be referenced only via symbols.\nparams[:q]\nparams[:book][:title]\n\n\nNow, what happens if the parameter :book is missing from the request?\nBecause params[:book] is nil, we can't access :title.\nIn this case Ruby will raise a NoMethodError.\n\nWe have a safe solution for our problem: #get.\nIt accepts a list of symbols, where each symbol represents a level in our nested structure.\nparams.get(:book, :title)             #

We pass them as a Hash and they are transformed into an instance of Hanami::Action::Params.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nExposures\n    \nThere are cases where we want to verify the internal state of an action.\nImagine we have a classic user profile page, like depicted in the example above.\nThe action asks for a record that corresponds to the given id, and then set a @user instance variable.\nHow do we verify that the record is the one that we are looking for?\n\nBecause we want to make @user available to the outside world, we're going to use an exposure.\nThey are used to pass a data payload between an action and the corresponding view.\nWhen we do expose :user, Hanami creates a getter (#user), so we can easily assert if the record is the right one.\n# apps/web/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include Web::Action\n    expose :user, :foo\n\n    def call(params)\n      @user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])\n      @foo  = 'bar'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe have used two exposures: :user and :foo, let's verify if they are properly set.\n# spec/web/controllers/users/show_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/show'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Users::Show do\n  before do\n    @user = UserRepository.new.create(name: 'Luca')\n  end\n\n  let(:action)  { Web::Controllers::Users::Show.new }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: @user.id)\n\n    response[0].must_equal 200\n\n    action.user.must_equal @user\n    action.exposures.must_equal({user: @user, foo: 'bar'})\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nThe internal state of an action can be easily verified with exposures.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nDependency Injection\n    \nDuring unit testing, we may want to use mocks to make tests faster or to avoid hitting external systems like databases, file system or remote services.\nBecause we can instantiate actions during tests, there is no need to use testing antipatterns (eg. any_instance_of, or UserRepository.new.stub(:find)).\nInstead, we can just specify which collaborators we want to use via dependency injection.\n\nLet's rewrite the test above so that it does not hit the database.\nWe're going to use RSpec for this example as it has a nicer API for mocks (doubles).\n# spec/web/controllers/users/show_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/show'\n\nRSpec.describe Web::Controllers::Users::Show do\n  let(:action)     { Web::Controllers::Users::Show.new(repository: repository) }\n  let(:user)       { User.new(id: 23, name: 'Luca') }\n  let(:repository) { double('repository', find: user) }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: user.id)\n\n    expect(response[0]).to      eq 200\n    expect(action.user).to      eq user\n    expect(action.exposures).to eq({user: user})\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe have injected the repository dependency which is a mock in our case.\nHere how to adapt our action.\n# apps/web/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include Web::Action\n    expose :user\n\n    def initialize(repository: UserRepository.new)\n      @repository = repository\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      @user = @repository.find(params[:id])\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nPlease be careful using doubles in unit tests. Always verify that the mocks are in a true representation of the corresponding production code.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFlash messages\n    \nIn your action tests, you can check flash messages too. For this, you can use exposures method for getting all flash data.\n\nThe following test example uses this method.\n# spec/web/controllers/users/create_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/create'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Users::Create do\n  let(:action)  { Web::Controllers::Users::Create.new }\n  let(:user_params) { name: 'Luca' }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: user_params)\n    flash = action.exposures[:flash]\n\n    flash[:info].must_equal 'User was successfully created'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nRequests Tests\n    \nUnit tests are a great tool to assert that low level interfaces work as expected.\nWe always advise combining them with integration tests.\n\nIn the case of Hanami web applications, we can write features (aka acceptance tests) with Capybara, but what do we use when we are building HTTP APIs?\nThe tool that we suggest is rack-test.\n\nImagine we have an API application mounted at /api/v1 in our Hanami::Container.\n# config/environment.rb\n# ...\nHanami::Container.configure do\n  mount ApiV1::Application, at: '/api/v1'\n  mount Web::Application,   at: '/'\nend\n\n\nThen we have the following action.\n# apps/api_v1/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule ApiV1::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include ApiV1::Action\n    accept :json\n\n    def call(params)\n      user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])\n      self.body = JSON.generate(user.to_h)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this case we don't care too much about the internal state of the action, but about the output visible to the external world.\nThis is why we haven't set user as an instance variable and why we haven't exposed it.\n# spec/api_v1/requests/users_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe \"API V1 users\" do\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\n\n  before do\n    @user = UserRepository.new.create(name: 'Luca')\n  end\n\n  # app is required by Rack::Test\n  def app\n    Hanami.app\n  end\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    get \"/api/v1/users/#{ @user.id }\"\n\n    last_response.must_be :ok?\n    last_response.body.must_equal(JSON.generate(@user.to_h))\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nPlease avoid test doubles when writing full integration tests, as we want to verify that the whole stack is behaving as expected.\n\n","url":"/guides/1.0/actions/testing/"},"102":{"title":"Guides -

Then when we edit the source file, the destination file becomes stale.\nGET /assets/application.js\n# edit the original file: apps/web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n# then require it again\nGET /assets/application.js\n\n\nIt copies the source into the destination file again (public/assets/application.js) and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrecompiled Asset\n    \nLet's say we use Sass to write our stylesheets.\nGET /assets/application.css\n\n\nIt preprocess the apps/web/assets/stylesheet/application.css.sass to public/assets/application.css and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDynamic Resource\n    GET /books/23\n\n\nThis isn't a static file available under public/, so the control passes to the backend that hits the appropriate action.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMissing Resource\n    GET /unknown\n\n\nThis isn't a static file or a dynamic resource, the project returns a 404 (Not Found).\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nEach application has a separated set of directories where its assets can be found.\nAssets are recursively searched under these paths.\n\nNew projects have a default directory where application assets can be put:\n% tree apps/web/assets\napps/web/assets\nâ”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico\nâ”œâ”€â”€ images\nâ”œâ”€â”€ javascripts\nâ””â”€â”€ stylesheets\n\n3 directories, 1 file\n\n\nWe can add as many directories we want under it (eg. apps/web/assets/fonts).\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the default asset directory is apps/web/assets\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAdding Sources\n    \nIf we want to add other sources for a given application, we can specify them in the configuration.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      # ...\n      assets do\n        # apps/web/assets is added by default\n        sources << [\n          'vendor/assets'\n        ]\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis will add apps/web/vendor/assets and all its subdirectories.\n\n\n  Hanami looks recursively through the asset sources. In order to NOT accidentally disclose sensitive files like secrets or source code, please make sure that these sources directories ONLY contain web assets.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nThird Party Gems\n    \nHanami allows developers to use Rubygems as a way to distribute web assets and make them available to Hanami applications.\n\nThird party gems can be maintained by developers who want to bring frontend framework support to Hanami.\nLet's say we want to build an hanami-emberjs gem.\n% tree .\n# ...\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hanami\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ emberjs\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ dist\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ember.js\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ember.min.js\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ version.rb\nâ”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ emberjs.rb\nâ”œâ”€â”€ hanami-emberjs.gemspec\n# ...\n\n\nWe put only the assets that we want to serve in an arbitrary directory.\nThen we add it to Hanami::Assets.sources.\n# lib/hanami/emberjs.rb\nrequire 'hanami/assets'\n\nmodule Hanami\n  module Emberjs\n    require 'hanami/emberjs/version'\n  end\nend\n\nHanami::Assets.sources << __dir__ + '/emberjs/source'\n\n\nWhen an application requires 'hanami/emberjs', that directory will be added to the sources where Hanami can search for assets.\n<%= javascript 'ember' %>\n\n\nThen we can use the javascript helper to include ember.js in our application.\n","url":"/guides/1.0/assets/overview/"},"106":{"title":"Guides - Assets Preprocessors","content":"      \n      \n      \nAssets\n    \n            \n      \n      \nPreprocessors\n    \nHanami is able to run assets preprocessors and lazily compile them under public/assets.\n\nImagine to have application.css.scss in apps/web/assets/stylesheets and reset.css under\napps/web/vendor/stylesheets.\n\nThe extensions structure is important.\nThe first one is mandatory and it's used to understand which asset type we are\nhandling: .css for stylesheets.\nThe second one is optional and it's for a preprocessor: .scss for Sass.\n\n\n  For a given asset application.css.scss, the last extension (.scss) is used to determine the right preprocessor.\n\n\n\n  Preprocessors are optional, an application can work with plain javascripts or stylesheets.

If you're reading this page, it's very likely that you want to learn more about Hanami.\n    That's great, congrats! If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable web applications, you're in good hands.\n  \n\n  \n    Hanami is built for people like you.\n  \n\n  \n    I warn you that whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer this learning process can be hard.\n    Over time, we build expectations about how things should be, and it can be painful to change. But without change, there is no challenge and without challenge, there is no growth.\n  \n\n  \n    Sometimes a feature doesn't look right, that doesn't mean it's you.\n    It can be a matter of formed habits, a design fallacy or even a bug.\n  \n\n  \n    Myself and the rest of the Community are putting best efforts to make Hanami better every day.\n  \n\n  \n    In this guide we will set up our first Hanami project and build a simple bookshelf web application.\n    We'll touch on all the major components of Hanami framework, all guided by tests.\n  \n\n  \n    If you feel alone, or frustrated, don't give up, jump in our chat and ask for help.\n    There will be someone more than happy to talk with you.\n  \n\n  \n    Enjoy,\n    Luca Guidi\n    Hanami creator\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrerequisites\n    \nBefore we get started, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.\nFirst, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.\n\nYou should also be familiar with Bundler, Rake, working with a terminal and building apps using the Model, View, Controller paradigm.\n\nLastly, in this guide we'll be using a SQLite database.\nIf you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCreate a New Hanami Project\n    \nTo create a new Hanami project, we need to install the Hanami gem from Rubygems.\nThen we can use the new hanami executable to generate a new project:\n% gem install hanami\n% hanami new bookshelf\n\n\n\n  By default, the project will be setup to use a SQLite database. For real-world projects, you can specify your engine:\n  \n  % hanami new bookshelf --database=postgres\n Â \n\n\nThis will create a new directory bookshelf in our current location.\nLet's see what it contains:\n% cd bookshelf\n% tree -L 1\n.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Rakefile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ apps\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config.ru\nâ”œâ”€â”€ db\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ”œâ”€â”€ public\nâ””â”€â”€ spec\n\n6 directories, 3 files\n\n\nHere's what we need to know:\n\n\nGemfile defines our Rubygems dependencies (using Bundler).\nRakefile describes our Rake tasks.\napps contains one or more web applications compatible with Rack.\nHere we can find the first generated Hanami application called Web.\nIt's the place where we find our controllers, views, routes and templates.\nconfig contains configuration files.\nconfig.ru is for Rack servers.\ndb contains our database schema and migrations.\nlib contains our business logic and domain model, including entities and repositories.\npublic will contain compiled static assets.\nspec contains our tests.\n\n\nGo ahead and install our gem dependency with Bundler; then we can launch a development server:\n% bundle install\n% bundle exec hanami server\n\n\nAnd... bask in the glory of your first Hanami project at\nhttp://localhost:2300! We should see a screen similar to this:\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Architecture\n    \nHanami architecture can host several Hanami (and Rack) applications in the same Ruby process.\n\nThese applications live under apps/.\nEach of them can be a component of our product, such as the user facing web interface, the admin pane, metrics, HTTP API etc..\n\nAll these parts are a delivery mechanism to the business logic that lives under lib/.\nThis is the place where our models are defined, and interact with each other to compose the features that our product provides.\n\nHanami architecture is heavily inspired by Clean Architecture.\n\n            \n      \n      \nWriting Our First Test\n    \nThe opening screen we see when we point our browser at our app, is a\ndefault page which is displayed when there are no routes defined.\n\nHanami encourages Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as a way to write web applications.\nIn order to get our first custom page to display, we'll write a high-level feature test:\n# spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Visit home' do\n  it 'is successful' do\n    visit '/'\n\n    page.body.must_include('Bookshelf')\n  end\nend\n\n\nNote that, although Hanami is ready for a Behavior Driven Development workflow out of the box, it is in no way bound to any particular testing framework -- nor does it come with special integrations or libraries.\n\nWe'll go with Minitest here (which is the default), but we can use RSpec by creating the project with --test=rspec option.\nHanami will then generate helpers and stub files for it.\n\n\n  Please check .env.test in case you need to tweak the database URL.\n\n\nWe have to migrate our schema in the test database by running:\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\nAs you can see, we have set HANAMI_ENV environment variable to instruct our command about the environment to use.\n\n            \n      \n      \nFollowing a Request\n    \nNow we have a test, we can see it fail:\n% bundle exec rake test\nRun options: --seed 44759\n\n# Running:\n\nF\n\nFinished in 0.018611s, 53.7305 runs/s, 53.7305 assertions/s.\n\n  1) Failure:\nHomepage#test_0001_is successful [/Users/hanami/bookshelf/spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb:6]:\nExpected \"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n  <head>\\n    <title>Not Found</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <h1>Not Found</h1>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n\" to include \"Bookshelf\".\n\n1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\nNow let's make it pass.\nLets add the code required to make this test pass, step-by-step.\n\nThe first thing we need to add is a route:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nroot to: 'home#index'\n\n\nWe pointed our application's root URL to the index action of the home controller (see the routing guide for more information).\nNow we can create the index action.\n# apps/web/controllers/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis is an empty action that doesn't implement any business logic.\nEach action has a corresponding view, which is a Ruby object and needs to be added in order to complete the request.\n# apps/web/views/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\n...which, in turn, is empty and does nothing more than render its template.\nThis is the file we need to edit in order to make our test pass. All we need to do is add the bookshelf heading.\n# apps/web/templates/home/index.html.erb\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n\n\nSave your changes, run your test again and it now passes. Great!\nRun options: --seed 19286\n\n# Running:\n\n.\n\nFinished in 0.011854s, 84.3600 runs/s, 168.7200 assertions/s.\n\n1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGenerating New Actions\n    \nLet's use our new knowledge about the major Hanami components to add a new action.\nThe purpose of our Bookshelf project is to manage books.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and let the user manage them with our project.\nA first step would be to show a listing of all the books in our system.\n\nLet's write a new feature test describing what we want to achieve:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe test is simple enough, and fails because the URL /books is not currently recognised in our application. We'll create a new controller action to fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Generators\n    \nHanami ships with various generators to save on typing some of the code involved in adding new functionality.\nIn our terminal, enter:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#index\n\n\nThis will generate a new action index in the books controller of the web application.\nIt gives us an empty action, view and template; it also adds a default route to apps/web/config/routes.rb:\nget '/books', to: 'books#index'\n\n\nIf you're using ZSH, you may get zsh: no matches found: books#index. In that case, you can use:\n\n% hanami generate action web books/index\n\n\nTo make our test pass, we need to edit our newly generated template file in apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb:\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<div id=\"books\">\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nSave your changes and see your tests pass! The output will also contain a skipped test. This is due to an autogenerated test in spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb.\n\nThe terminology of controllers and actions might be confusing, so let's clear this up: actions form the basis of our Hanami applications; controllers are mere modules that group several actions together.\nSo while the \"controller\" is conceptually present in our project, in practice we only deal with actions.\n\nWe've used a generator to create a new endpoint in our application.\nBut one thing you may have noticed is that our new template contains the same <h1> as our home/index.html.erb template.\nLet's fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nLayouts\n    \nTo avoid repeating ourselves in every single template, we can use a layout.\nOpen up the file apps/web/templates/application.html.erb and edit it to look like this:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Bookshelf</title>\n    <%= favicon %>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n    <%= yield %>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nNow you can remove the duplicate lines from the other templates. Let's run the tests again to check that everything worked fine:\nbundle exec rake test\n\n\nA layout is like any other template, but it is used to wrap your regular templates.\nThe yield line is replaced with the contents of our regular template.\nIt's the perfect place to put our repeating headers and footers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nModeling Our Data With Entities\n    \nHard-coding books in our templates is, admittedly, kind of cheating.\nLet's add some dynamic data to our application.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and display them on our page.\nTo do so, we need a way to read and write to our database.\nEnter entities and repositories:\n\n\nan entity is a domain object (eg. Book) uniquely identified by its identity.\na repository mediates between entities and the persistence layer.\n\n\nEntities are totally unaware of the database.\nThis makes them lightweight and easy to test.\n\nFor this reason we need a repository to persist the data that a Book depends on.\nRead more about entities and repositories in the models guide.\n\nHanami ships with a generator for models, so let's use it to create a Book entity and the corresponding repository:\n% bundle exec hanami generate model book\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb\ncreate  db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository_spec.rb\n\n\nThe generator gives us an entity, a repository, a migration, and accompanying test files.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMigrations To Change Our Database Schema\n    \nLet's modify the generated migration (the path to the migration will differ for you, because it contains a timestamp) to include title and author fields:\n# db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\n\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  change do\n    create_table :books do\n      primary_key :id\n\n      column :title,  String, null: false\n      column :author, String, null: false\n\n      column :created_at, DateTime, null: false\n      column :updated_at, DateTime, null: false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nHanami provides a DSL to describe changes to our database schema. You can read more\nabout how migrations work in the migrations' guide.\n\nIn this case, we define a new table with columns for each of our entities' attributes.\nLet's prepare our database for the development and test environments:\n% bundle exec hanami db prepare\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWorking With Entities\n    \nAn entity is something really close to a plain Ruby object.\nWe should focus on the behaviors that we want from it and only then, how to save it.\n\nFor now, we keep the generated entity class:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\nclass Book < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\nThis class will generate getters and setters for each attribute which we pass to initialize params.\nWe can verify it all works as expected with a unit test:\n# spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Book do\n  it 'can be initialized with attributes' do\n    book = Book.new(title: 'Refactoring')\n    book.title.must_equal 'Refactoring'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Repositories\n    \nNow we are ready to play around with our repository.\nWe can use Hanami's console command to launch IRb with our application pre-loaded, so we can use our objects:\n% bundle exec hanami console\n>> repository = BookRepository.new\n=> => #<BookRepository relations=[:books]>\n>> repository.all\n=> []\n>> book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab61c23b8 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n>> repository.find(book.id)\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab6181610 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n\n\nHanami repositories have methods to load one or more entities from our database; and to create and update existing records.\nThe repository is also the place where you would define new methods to implement custom queries.\n\nTo recap, we've seen how Hanami uses entities and repositories to model our data.\nEntities represent our behavior, while repositories use mappings to translate our entities to our data store.\nWe can use migrations to apply changes to our database schema.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Dynamic Data\n    \nWith our new experience modelling data, we can get to work displaying dynamic data on our book listing page.\nLet's adjust the feature test we created earlier:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    repository.create(title: 'PoEAA', author: 'Martin Fowler')\n    repository.create(title: 'TDD',   author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe create the required records in our test and then assert the correct number of book classes on the page.\nWhen we run this test it should pass. If it does not pass, a likely reason is that the test database was not migrated.\n\nNow we can go change our template and remove the static HTML.\nOur view needs to loop over all available records and render them.\nLet's write a test to force this change in our view:\n# spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::Index do\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[books: []] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::Index.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'exposes #books' do\n    view.books.must_equal exposures.fetch(:books)\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are no books' do\n    it 'shows a placeholder message' do\n      rendered.must_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are books' do\n    let(:book1)     { Book.new(title: 'Refactoring', author: 'Martin Fowler') }\n    let(:book2)     { Book.new(title: 'Domain Driven Design', author: 'Eric Evans') }\n    let(:exposures) { Hash[books: [book1, book2]] }\n\n    it 'lists them all' do\n      rendered.scan(/class=\"book\"/).count.must_equal 2\n      rendered.must_include('Refactoring')\n      rendered.must_include('Domain Driven Design')\n    end\n\n    it 'hides the placeholder message' do\n      rendered.wont_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify that our index page will show a simple placeholder message when there are no books to display; when there are, it lists every one of them.\nNote how rendering a view with some data is relatively straight-forward.\nHanami is designed around simple objects with minimal interfaces that are easy to test in isolation, yet still work great together.\n\nLet's rewrite our template to implement these requirements:\n# apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<% if books.any? %>\n  <div id=\"books\">\n    <% books.each do |book| %>\n      <div class=\"book\">\n        <h2><%= book.title %></h2>\n        <p><%= book.author %></p>\n      </div>\n    <% end %>\n  </div>\n<% else %>\n  <p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>\n<% end %>\n\n\nIf we run our feature test now, we'll see it fails â€” because our controller\naction does not actually expose the books to our view. We can write a test for\nthat change:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Index do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Index.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    @book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'is successful' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n    response[0].must_equal 200\n  end\n\n  it 'exposes all books' do\n    action.call(params)\n    action.exposures[:books].must_equal [@book]\n  end\nend\n\n\nWriting tests for controller actions is basically two-fold: you either assert on the response object, which is a Rack-compatible array of status, headers and content; or on the action itself, which will contain exposures after we've called it.\nNow we've specified that the action exposes :books, we can implement our action:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :books\n\n    def call(params)\n      @books = BookRepository.new.all\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nBy using the expose method in our action class, we can expose the contents of our @books instance variable to the outside world, so that Hanami can pass it to the view.\nThat's enough to make all our tests pass again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59133\n\n# Running:\n\n.........\n\nFinished in 0.042065s, 213.9543 runs/s, 380.3633 assertions/s.\n\n9 runs, 16 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nBuilding Forms To Create Records\n    \nOne of the last remaining steps is to make it possible to add new books to the system.\nThe plan is simple: we build a page with a form to enter details.\n\nWhen the user submits the form, we build a new entity, save it, and redirect the user back to the book listing.\nHere's that story expressed in a test:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  after do\n    BookRepository.new.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'can create a new book' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      fill_in 'Title',  with: 'New book'\n      fill_in 'Author', with: 'Some author'\n\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n    assert page.has_content?('New book')\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLaying The Foundations For A Form\n    \nBy now, we should be familiar with the working of actions, views and templates.\n\nWe'll speed things up a little, so we can quickly get to the good parts.\nFirst, create a new action for our \"New Book\" page:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#new\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\n\n\nThe interesting bit will be our new template, because we'll be using Hanami's form builder to construct a HTML form around our Book entity.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Form Helpers\n    \nLet's use form helpers to build this form in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb:\n# apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb\n<h2>Add book</h2>\n\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :title\n      text_field :title\n    end\n\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :author\n      text_field :author\n    end\n\n    div class: 'controls' do\n      submit 'Create Book'\n    end\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe've added <label> tags for our form fields, and wrapped each field in a\ncontainer <div> using Hanami's HTML builder helper.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSubmitting Our Form\n    \nTo submit our form, we need yet another action.\nLet's create a Books::Create action:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#create\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books', to: 'books#create'\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImplementing Create Action\n    \nOur books#create action needs to do two things.\nLet's express them as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'creates a new book' do\n    action.call(params)\n    book = repository.last\n\n    book.id.wont_be_nil\n    book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n  end\n\n  it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n\n    response[0].must_equal 302\n    response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n  end\nend\n\n\nLet's make these tests pass!\nWe've already seen how we can write entities to our database, and we can use redirect_to to implement our redirection:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n      redirect_to '/books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis minimal implementation should suffice to make our tests pass.\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 63592\n\n# Running:\n\n...S.S.........\n\nFinished in 0.081961s, 183.0142 runs/s, 305.0236 assertions/s.\n\n15 runs, 23 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 2 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\n            \n      \n      \nSecuring Our Form With Validations\n    \nHold your horses! We need some extra measures to build a truly robust form.\nImagine what would happen if the user were to submit the form without entering any values?\n\nWe could fill our database with bad data or see an exception for data integrity violations.\nWe clearly need a way of keeping invalid data out of our system!\n\nTo express our validations in a test, we need to wonder: what would happen if our validations failed?\nOne option would be to re-render the books#new form, so we can give our users another shot at completing it correctly.\nLet's specify this behaviour as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  describe 'with valid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n\n    it 'creates a book' do\n      action.call(params)\n      book = repository.last\n\n      book.id.wont_be_nil\n      book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n    end\n\n    it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n\n      response[0].must_equal 302\n      response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'with invalid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: {}] }\n\n    it 'returns HTTP client error' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n      response[0].must_equal 422\n    end\n\n    it 'dumps errors in params' do\n      action.call(params)\n      errors = action.params.errors\n\n      errors.dig(:book, :title).must_equal  ['is missing']\n      errors.dig(:book, :author).must_equal ['is missing']\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow our tests specify two alternative scenarios: our original happy path, and a new scenario in which validations fail.\nTo make our tests pass, we need to implement validations.\n\nAlthough you can add validation rules to the entity, Hanami also allows you to define validation rules as close to the source of the input as possible, i.e. the action.\nHanami controller actions can use the params class method to define acceptable incoming parameters.\n\nThis approach both whitelists what params are used (others are discarded to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities from untrusted user input) and adds rules to define what values are acceptable â€” in this case we've specified that the nested attributes for a book's title and author should be present.\n\nWith our validations in place, we can limit our entity creation and redirection to cases where the incoming params are valid:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :book\n\n    params do\n      required(:book).schema do\n        required(:title).filled(:str?)\n        required(:author).filled(:str?)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      if params.valid?\n        @book = BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n        redirect_to '/books'\n      else\n        self.status = 422\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhen the params are valid, the Book is created and the action redirects to a different URL.\nBut when the params are not valid, what happens?\n\nFirst, the HTTP status code is set to\n422 (Unprocessable Entity).\nThen the control will pass to the corresponding view, which needs to know which template to render.\nIn this case apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb will be used to render the form again.\n# apps/web/views/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::View\n    template 'books/new'\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis approach will work nicely because Hanami's form builder is smart enough to inspect the params in this action and populate the form fields with values found in the params.\nIf the user fills in only one field before submitting, they are presented with their original input, saving them the frustration of typing it again.\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Validation Errors\n    \nRather than just shoving the user a form under their nose when something has gone wrong, we should give them a hint of what's expected of them. Let's adapt our form to show a notice about invalid fields.\n\nFirst, we expect a list of errors to be included in the page when params contains errors:\n# spec/web/views/books/new_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::New do\n  let(:params)    { OpenStruct.new(valid?: false, error_messages: ['Title must be filled', 'Author must be filled']) }\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[params: params] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::New.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    rendered.must_include('There was a problem with your submission')\n    rendered.must_include('Title must be filled')\n    rendered.must_include('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe should also update our feature spec to reflect this new behavior:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  # Spec written earlier omitted for brevity\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n\n    assert page.has_content?('There was a problem with your submission')\n    assert page.has_content?('Title must be filled')\n    assert page.has_content?('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn our template we can loop over params.errors (if there are any) and display a friendly message.\nOpen up apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb and add the following at the top of the file:\n<% unless params.valid? %>\n  <div class=\"errors\">\n    <h3>There was a problem with your submission</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <% params.error_messages.each do |message| %>\n        <li><%= message %></li>\n      <% end %>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n<% end %>\n\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59940\n\n# Running:\n\n......S..........\n\nFinished in 0.188950s, 89.9707 runs/s, 179.9413 assertions/s.\n\n17 runs, 34 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImproving Our Use Of The Router\n    \nThe last improvement we are going to make, is in the use of our router.\nOpen up the routes file for the \"web\" application:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books',    to: 'books#create'\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\nget '/books',     to: 'books#index'\nroot              to: 'home#index'\n\n\nHanami provides a convenient helper method to build these REST-style routes, that we can use to simplify our router a bit:\nroot to: 'home#index'\nresources :books, only: [:index, :new, :create]\n\n\nTo get a sense of what routes are defined, now we've made this change, you can\nrun bundle exec hanami routes on your command-line to inspect the end result:\n% bundle exec hanami routes\n     Name Method     Path                           Action\n\n     root GET, HEAD  /                              Web::Controllers::Home::Index\n    books GET, HEAD  /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Index\n new_book GET, HEAD  /books/new                     Web::Controllers::Books::New\n    books POST       /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Create\n\n\nThe output shows you the name of the defined helper method (you can suffix this name with _path or _url and call it on the routes helper), the allowed HTTP method, the path and finally the controller action that will be used to handle the request.\n\nNow we've applied the resources helper method, we can take advantage of the named route methods.\nRemember how we built our form using form_for in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb?\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe don't need to include a hard-coded path in our template, when our router is already perfectly aware of which route to point the form to.\nWe can use the routes helper method that is available in our views and actions to access route-specific helper methods:\n<%=\n  form_for :book, routes.books_path do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe can make a similar change in apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb:\nredirect_to routes.books_path\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWrapping Up\n    \nCongratulations for completing your first Hanami project!\n\nLet's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.\n\nWe've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore.\nExplore the other guides, the Hanami API documentation, read the source code and follow the blog.\n\nAbove all, enjoy

just Ruby modules, we can create our own helpers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we need (for some reason) a helper that shuffles the characters of a string and we want it to

is NO convention between the file name and the name of the module.\n  We can define this code, where and how we want.\n\n\nThen let's add that directory to the load paths of the application, so it can be eagerly loaded.\nAs third step, we include the module in all the views.

Hanami offers a security mechanism based on a technique called: Synchronizer Token Pattern.\n\nWhen we enable sessions, it uses them to store a random token for each user.\nForms are rendered with a special hidden field (_csrf_token) which contains this token.\n\nOn form submission, Hanami matches this input with the value from the session. If they match, the request can continue. If not, it resets the session and raises an exception.\n\nDevelopers can customize attack handling.\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested fields\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for :address do\n      text_field :city\n    end\n\n    submit 'Create'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[address][city]\" id=\"delivery-address-city\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested collections\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for_collection :addresses do\n      text_field :street\n    end\n\n  submit 'Create'\nend\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" method=\"POST\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"delivery-form\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"920cd5bfaecc6e58368950e790f2f7b4e5561eeeab230aa1b7de1b1f40ea7d5d\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-0-street\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-1-street\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAutomatic values\n    \nForm fields are automatically filled with the right value. Hanami looks up for explicit values passed in the form constructor and for the params of the current request. It compares the form hierarchy (including nested fields), with these two sources. For each match, it fills the associated value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we want to update data for delivery. We have two objects: delivery and customer, which are plain objects (no ORM involved). They respond to the following methods:\ndelivery.id   # => 1\ndelivery.code # => 123\n\ncustomer.name # => \"Luca\"\n\ncustomer.address.class # => Address\ncustomer.address.city  # => \"Rome\"\n\n\nLet's compose the form.\n<%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.delivery_path(id: delivery.id), method: :patch, values: {delivery: delivery, customer: customer} do\n    text_field :code\n\n    fields_for :customer do\n      text_field :name\n\n      fields_for :address do\n        text_field :city\n      end\n    end\n\n    submit 'Update'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"123\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n\nPlease note the :values option that we pass to #form_for. It maps the name attributes that we have in the form with the objects that we want to use to fill the values. For instance delivery[code] corresponds to delivery.code (123), delivery[customer][address][city] to customer.address.city (\"Rome\") and so on..\n\n            \n      \n      \nRead Values From Params\n    \nParams are automatically passed to form helpers, to read values and try to autofill fields. If a value is present both in params and explicit values (:values), the first takes precendence. The reason is simple: params sometimes represent a failed form submission attempt.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine the form described above, and that our user enters \"foo\" as delivery code. This value isn't acceptable for our model domain rules, so we render again the form, presenting a validation error. Our params are now carrying on the values filled by our user. For instance: params.get('delivery.code') returns \"foo\".\n\nHere how the form is rendered:\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"foo\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n","url":"/guides/1.0/helpers/forms/"},"121":{"title":"Guides - HTML5 Helpers","content":"      \n      \n      \nHTML5 Helpers\n    \nThis helper makes available an HTML5 generator that is template engine independent.\nIt's a private method for views and layouts called #html.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsage\n    \nThis is how it will look used with a layout:\nmodule Web::Views\n  class ApplicationLayout\n    include Web::Layout\n\n    def sidebar\n      html.aside(id: 'sidebar') do\n        div 'hello'\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n<%= sidebar %>\n\n\nIt generates:\n<aside id=\"sidebar\">\n  <div>hello</div>\n</aside>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFeatures\n    \n\nIt knows how to close tags according to HTML5 spec (1)\nIt accepts content as first argument (2)\nIt accepts builder as first argument (3)\nIt accepts content as block which returns a string (4)\nIt accepts content as a block with nested markup builders (5)\nIt builds attributes from given hash (6)\nit combines attributes and block (7)\n\n# 1\nhtml.div # => <div></div>\nhtml.img # => <img>\n\n# 2\nhtml.div('hello') # => <div>hello</div>\n\n# 3\nhtml.div(html.p('hello')) # => <div><p>hello</p></div>\n\n# 4\nhtml.div { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n# 5\nhtml.div do\n  p 'hello'\nend\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  <p>hello</p>\n#</div>\n\n# 6\nhtml.div('hello', id: 'el', 'data-x': 'y') # => <div id=\"el\" data-x=\"y\">hello</div>\n\n# 7\nhtml.div(id: 'yay') { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div id=\"yay\">\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n\nIt supports complex markup constructs, without the need of concatenate tags.

Repositories","content":"      \n      \n      \nRepositories\n    \nAn object that mediates between entities and the persistence layer.\nIt offers a standardized API to query and execute commands on a database.\n\nA repository is storage independent, all the queries and commands are\ndelegated to the current adapter.\n\nThis architecture has several advantages:\n\n\nApplications depend on a standard API, instead of low level details\n(Dependency Inversion principle)\nApplications depend on a stable API, that doesn't change if the\nstorage changes\nDevelopers can postpone storage decisions\nConfines persistence logic to a low level\nMultiple data sources can easily coexist in an application\n\n\n\n  As of the current version, Hanami only supports SQL databases.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nWhen a class inherits from Hanami::Repository, it will receive the following interface:\n\n\n#create(data) â€“ Create a record for the given data and return an entity\n#update(id, data) â€“ Update the record corresponding to the id and return the updated entity\n#delete(id) â€“ Delete the record corresponding to the given entity\n#all - Fetch all the entities from the collection\n#find(id) - Fetch an entity from the collection by its ID\n#first - Fetch the first entity from the collection\n#last  - Fetch the last entity from the collection\n#clear - Delete all the records from the collection\n\n\nA collection is a homogenous set of records.\nIt corresponds to a table for a SQL database or to a MongoDB collection.\nrepository = BookRepository.new\n\nbook = repository.create(title: \"Hanami\")\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cbd8b7c0 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC}>\n\nbook = repository.find(book.id)\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cbd5a030 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC}>\n\nbook = repository.update(book.id, title: \"Hanami Book\")\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cb243408 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami Book\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:03:34 UTC}>\n\nrepository.delete(book.id)\n\nrepository.find(book.id)\n  # => nil\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSaving more than one record\n    \nFor saving bunch of records you need to define a #create_many command:\nclass BookRepository\n  def create_many(list)\n    command(:create, books, result: :many).call(list)\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow you can use #create_many as a bulk creation method:\nBookRepository.new.create_many([{ title: \"Hanami\" }, { title: \"Ruby\"}])\n# => [#<Book:0x007f95cbd8b7c0 @attributes={...}>, #<Book:0x007ff4e20e6f80 @attributes={...}>]\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrivate Queries\n    \nAll the queries are private.\nThis decision forces developers to define intention revealing API, instead of leaking storage API details outside of a repository.\n\nLook at the following code:\nBookRepository.new.where(author_id: 23).order(:published_at).limit(8)\n\n\nThis is bad for a variety of reasons:\n\n\nThe caller has an intimate knowledge of the internal mechanisms of the Repository.\nThe caller works on several levels of abstraction.\nIt doesn't express a clear intent, it's just a chain of methods.\nThe caller can't be easily tested in isolation.\nIf we change the storage, we are forced to change the code of the caller(s).\n\n\nThere is a better way:\n# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def most_recent_by_author(author, limit: 8)\n    books\n      .where(author_id: author.id)\n      .order(:published_at)\n      .limit(limit)\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis is a huge improvement, because:\n\n\nThe caller doesn't know how the repository fetches the entities.\nThe caller works on a single level of abstraction. It doesn't even know about records, only works with entities.\nIt expresses a clear intent.\nThe caller can be easily tested in isolation. It's just a matter of stubbing this method.\nIf we change the storage, the callers aren't affected.\n\n\n\n  \n    Hanami queries are based on gems from ROM project, namely\n    rom-repository and rom-sql.\n    The gem rom-sql is itself based on Sequel project.\n  \n  \n    Learn more on how to craft queries with\n    ROM\n    and Sequel.\n  \n\n\n            \n      \n      \nTimestamps\n    \nTo have a track of when a record has been created or updated is important when running a project in production.\n\nWhen creating a new table, if we add the following columns, a repository will take care of keeping the values updated.\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  up do\n    create_table :books do\n      # ...\n      column :created_at, DateTime\n      column :updated_at, DateTime\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nrepository = BookRepository.new\n\nbook = repository.create(title: \"Hanami\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\n\nbook = repository.update(book.id, title: \"Hanami Book\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:22:40 UTC\n\n\n\n  When a database table has created_at and updated_at timestamps, a repository will automatically update their values.\n\n\n\n  Timestamps are on UTC timezone.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLegacy Databases\n    \nBy default, a repository performs auto-mapping of corresponding database table and creates an automatic schema for the associated entity.\n\nWhen working with legacy databases we can resolve the naming mismatch between the table name, the columns, with repositories defaults and entities attributes.\n\nLet's say we have a database table like this:\nCREATE TABLE t_operator (\n    operator_id integer NOT NULL,\n    s_name text\n);\n\n\nWe can setup our repository with the following code:\n# lib/bookshelf/repositories/operator_repository.rb\nclass OperatorRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  self.relation = :t_operator\n\n  mapping do\n    attribute :id,   from: :operator_id\n    attribute :name, from: :s_name\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhile the entity can stay with the basic setup:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/operator.rb\nclass Operator < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe entity now gets the mapping we defined in the repository:\noperator = Operator.new(name: \"Jane\")\noperator.name # => \"Jane\"\n\n\nThe repository can use the same mapped attributes:\noperator = OperatorRepository.new.create(name: \"Jane\")\n  # => #<Operator:0x007f8e43cbcea0 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>\"Jane\"}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCount\n    \nCount is a concept not generally available to all the databases. SQL databases have it, but others don't.\n\nYou can define a method, if you're using a SQL database:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def count\n    books.count\n  end\nend\n\n\nOr you can expose specific conditions:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def on_sale_count\n    books.where(on_sale: true).count\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf you want to use raw SQL you can do:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def old_books_count\n    books.read(\"SELECT id FROM books WHERE created_at < (NOW() - 1 * interval '1 year')\").count\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nRetrieving the first and last records\n    \nA repository provides default #first and #lastÂ methods, but they don't have any sorting policy.\n\nIf you need to specify a custom sorting policy you can use #order:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def newest_book\n    books.order { created_at }.limit(1).one\n    # Passing a symbol instead works too: books.order(:created_at).one\n  end\n\n  def oldest_book\n    books.order { created_at.desc }.limit(1).one\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhen #one is used if no record is find, it returns nil.\n\nPlease remember to always use limit(1), otherwise #one will raise an exception.\n\nYou can read more in this issue.\n","url":"/guides/1.0/models/repositories/"},"143":{"title":"Guides - SQL Queries","content":"      \n      \n      \nSort\n    \nYou can sort records using #order:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def from_first_to_last\n    users.order { created_at.asc }\n  end\n\n  def from_last_to_first\n    users.order { created_at.desc }\n  end\n\n  def alphabetical\n    users.order { name.asc }\n  end\n\n  def alphabetical_reverse\n    users.order { name.asc }\n  end\n\n  def sort_via_other_relation\n    users.order(books[:title].qualified.asc)\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLimit\n    \nYou can use #limit to limit the number of records fetched from the database:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def last_created(number)\n    users.order { created_at.desc }.limit(number)\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSQL Functions\n    \nYou can use any SQL functions like ILIKE, IN, NOT, LENGTH, etc..\nThese functions are available as Ruby methods inside the #where block:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def by_name(name)\n    users.where { name.ilike(\"%?%\", name) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_in(input)\n    users.where { id.in(input) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_in_range(range)\n    users.where { id.in(range) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_min_max(min, max)\n    users.where { id > min || id < max }\n  end\n\n  def by_not_id(input)\n    users.where { id.not(input) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_not_in_range(range)\n    users.where { id.not(1..100) }\n  end\n\n  def by_name_length(input)\n    users.where { length(:name) > input }\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nJoins\n    \nYou can join several relations:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  associations do\n    has_many :comments\n  end\n\n  def commented_within(date_range)\n    books\n      .join(comments)\n      .where(comments[:created_at].qualified => date_range)\n      .as(Book)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nFor a given relation named :books, the used foreign key in :comments is :book_id.

Subdomain\n    mount Blog.new, host: 'blog'\n\n\nAll the HTTP requests to http://blog.example.com will be routed to Blog.\n\n\n  In development, you will NOT be able to access http://blog.localhost:2300,\n  so you should specify a host when running the server:\n  bundle exec hanami server --host=lvh.me.\n  Then your application can be visited at

We can express this concept with two methods in our validations: required (which we already met in previous examples), and optional.\nrequire 'hanami/validations'\n\nclass Signup\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email)    { ... }\n    optional(:referral) { ... }\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nType Safety\n    \nAt this point, we need to explicitly tell something really important about built-in predicates. Each of them have expectations about the methods that an input is able to respond to.\n\nWhy this is so important? Because if we try to invoke a method on the input weâ€™ll get a NoMethodError if the input doesnâ€™t respond to it. Which isnâ€™t nice, right?\n\nBefore to use a predicate, we want to ensure that the input is an instance of the expected type. Letâ€™s introduce another new predicate for our need: #type?.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) & gteq?(18) }\n\n\nIt takes the input and tries to coerce it. If it fails, the execution stops. If it succeed, the subsequent predicates can trust #type? and be sure that the input is an integer.\n\nWe suggest to use #type? at the beginning of the validations block. This type safety policy is crucial to prevent runtime errors.\n\nHanami::Validations supports the most common Ruby types:\n\n\nArray (aliased as array?)\nBigDecimal (aliased as decimal?)\nBoolean (aliased as bool?)\nDate (aliased as date?)\nDateTime (aliased as date_time?)\nFloat (aliased as float?)\nHash (aliased as hash?)\nInteger (aliased as int?)\nString (aliased as str?)\nTime (aliased as time?)\n\n\nFor each supported type, there a convenient predicate that acts as an alias. For instance, the two lines of code below are equivalent.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) }\nrequired(:age) { int? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMacros\n    \nRule composition with blocks is powerful, but it can become verbose.\nTo reduce verbosity, Hanami::Validations offers convenient macros that are internally expanded (aka interpreted) to an equivalent block expression\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nTo use when we expect a value to be filled:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? }\n\nrequired(:age).filled\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?)\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) & gt?(18) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n\n\nIn the examples above age is always required as value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaybe\n    \nTo use when a value can be nil:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { none? | int? }\n\nrequired(:age).maybe(:int?)\n\n\nIn the example above age can be nil, but if we send the value, it must be an integer.\n\n            \n      \n      \nEach\n    \nTo use when we want to apply the same validation rules to all the elements of an array:\n# expands to\n# required(:tags) { array? { each { str? } } }\n\nrequired(:tags).each(:str?)\n\n\nIn the example above tags must be an array of strings.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfirmation\n    \nThis is designed to check if pairs of web form fields have the same value. One wildly popular example is password confirmation.\nrequired(:password).filled.confirmation\n\n\nIt is valid if the input has password and password_confirmation keys with the same exact value.\n\nâš  CONVENTION: For a given key password, the confirmation predicate expects another key password_confirmation. Easy to tell, itâ€™s the concatenation of the original key with the _confirmation suffix. Their values must be equal. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nForms\n    \nAn important precondition to check before to implement a validator is about the expected input.\nWhen we use validators for already preprocessed data it's safe to use basic validations from Hanami::Validations mixin.\n\nIf the data is coming directly from user input via a HTTP form, it's advisable to use Hanami::Validations::Form instead.\nThe two mixins have the same API, but the latter is able to do low level input preprocessing specific for forms. For instance, blank inputs are casted to nil in order to avoid blank strings in the database.\n\n            \n      \n      \nRules\n    \nPredicates and macros are tools to code validations that concern a single key like first_name or email.\nIf the outcome of a validation depends on two or more attributes we can use rules.\n\nHere's a practical example: a job board.\nWe want to validate the form of the job creation with some mandatory fields: type (full time, part-time, contract), title (eg. Developer), description, company (just the name) and a website (which is optional).\nAn user must specify the location: on-site or remote. If it's on site, they must specify the location, otherwise they have to tick the checkbox for remote.\n\nHere's the code:\nclass CreateJob\n  include Hanami::Validations::Form\n\n  validations do\n    required(:type).filled(:int?, included_in?: [1, 2, 3])\n\n    optional(:location).maybe(:str?)\n    optional(:remote).maybe(:bool?)\n\n    required(:title).filled(:str?)\n    required(:description).filled(:str?)\n    required(:company).filled(:str?)\n\n    optional(:website).filled(:str?, format?: URI.regexp(%w(http https)))\n\n    rule(location_presence: [:location, :remote]) do |location, remote|\n      (remote.none? | remote.false?).then(location.filled?) &\n        remote.true?.then(location.none?)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify a rule with rule method, which takes an arbitrary name and an array of preconditions.\nOnly if :location and :remote are valid according to their validations described above, the rule block is evaluated.\n\nThe block yields the same exact keys that we put in the precondintions.\nSo for [:location, :remote] it will yield the corresponding values, bound to the location and remote variables.\n\nWe can use these variables to define the rule. We covered a few cases:\n\n\nIf remote is missing or false, then location must be filled\nIf remote is true, then location must be omitted\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested Input Data\n    \nWhile weâ€™re building complex web forms, we may find comfortable to organise data in a hierarchy of cohesive input fields. For instance, all the fields related to a customer, may have the customer prefix. To reflect this arrangement on the server side, we can group keys.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:name)  { â€¦ }\n    # other validations â€¦\n  end\nend\n\n\nGroups can be deeply nested, without any limitation.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    # other validations â€¦\n\n    required(:address).schema do\n      required(:street) { â€¦ }\n      # other address validations â€¦\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nComposition\n    \nUntil now, we have seen only small snippets to show specific features. That really close view prevents us to see the big picture of complex real world projects.\n\nAs the code base grows, itâ€™s a good practice to DRY validation rules.\nclass AddressValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:street) { â€¦ }\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis validator can be reused by other validators.\nclass CustomerValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:address).schema(AddressValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nAgain, there is no limit to the nesting levels.\nclass OrderValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:number) { â€¦ }\n    required(:customer).schema(CustomerValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn the end, OrderValidator is able to validate a complex data structure like this:\n{\n  number: \"123\",\n  customer: {\n    email: \"user@example.com\",\n    address: {\n      city: \"Rome\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWhitelisting\n    \nAnother fundamental role that validators plays in the architecture of our projects is input whitelisting.\nFor security reasons, we want to allow known keys to come in and reject everything else.\n\nThis process happens when we invoke #validate.\nAllowed keys are the ones defined with .required.\n\nPlease note that whitelisting is only available for Hanami::Validations::Form mixin.\n\n            \n      \n      \nResult\n    \nWhen we trigger the validation process with #validate, we get a result object in return. Itâ€™s able to tell if itâ€™s successful, which rules the input data has violated and an output data bag.\nresult = OrderValidator.new({}).validate\nresult.success? # => false\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMessages\n    \nresult.messages returns a nested set of validation error messages.\n\nEach error carries on informations about a single rule violation.\nresult.messages.fetch(:number)   # => [\"is missing\"]\nresult.messages.fetch(:customer) # => [\"is missing\"]\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nOutput\n    \nresult.output is a Hash which is the result of whitelisting and coercions. Itâ€™s useful to pass it do other components that may want to persist that data.\n{\n  \"number\"  => \"123\",\n  \"unknown\" => \"foo\"\n}\n\n\nIf we receive the input above, output will look like this.\nresult.output\n  # => { :number => 123 }\n\n\nWe can observe that:\n\n\nKeys are symbolized\nOnly whitelisted keys are included\nData is coerced\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nError Messages\n    \nTo pick the right error message is crucial for user experience.\nAs usual Hanami::Validations comes to the rescue for most common cases and it leaves space to customization of behaviors.\n\nWe have seen that builtin predicates have default messages, while inline predicates allow to specify a custom message via the :message option.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  predicate :email?, message: 'must be an email' do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?               # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:email) # => ['must be an email']\nresult.messages.fetch(:age)   # => ['must be greater than 18']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfigurable Error Messages\n    \nInline error messages are ideal for quick and dirty development, but we suggest to use an external YAML file to configure these messages:\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n\nTo be used like this:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n\n  predicate :email? do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom Error Messages\n    \nIn the example above, the failure message for age is fine: \"must be greater than 18\", but how to tweak it? What if we need to change into something diffent? Again, we can use the YAML configuration file for our purpose.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n    rules:\n      signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\nNow our validator is able to look at the right error message.\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?             # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:age) # => ['must be an adult']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom namespace\n    \nâš  CONVENTION: For a given validator named SignupValidator, the framework will look for signup translation key. âš \n\nIf for some reason that doesn't work for us, we can customize the namespace:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n  namespace     :my_signup\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nThe new namespace should be used in the YAML file too.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  # ...\n    rules:\n      my_signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInternationalization (I18n)\n    \nIf your project already depends on i18n gem, Hanami::Validations is able to look at the translations defined for that gem and to use them.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages :i18n\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n# config/locales/en.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    signup:\n      # ...\n\n","url":"/guides/1.0/validations/advanced-usage/"},"160":{"title":"Guides - Boolean Logic","content":"      \n      \n      \nBoolean Logic\n    \nWhen we check data, we expect only two outcomes: an input can be valid or not. No grey areas, nor fuzzy results. Itâ€™s white or black, 1 or 0, true or false and boolean logic is the perfect tool to express these two states. Indeed, a Ruby boolean expression can only return true or false.\n\nTo better recognise the pattern, letâ€™s get back to the example above. This time we will map the natural language rules with programming language rules.\nrequired(:name) { filled? & str? & size? (3..64) }\n\n\nNow, I hope youâ€™ll never format code like that, but in this case, that formatting serves well our purpose to show how Rubyâ€™s  simplicity helps to define complex rules with no effort.\n\nFrom a high level perspective, we can tell that input data for name is valid only if all the requirements are satisfied.

Scenarios like password confirmation, size check are already prepackaged with Hanami::Validations.\n\nâš  For this reason, we don't allow any arbitrary Ruby code to be executed, but only well defined predicates. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nPredicates\n    \nTo meet our needs, Hanami::Validations has an extensive collection of built-in predicates. A predicate is the expression of a business requirement (e.g. size greater than). The chain of several predicates determines if input data is valid or not.\n\nWe already met filled? and size?, now letâ€™s introduce the rest of them. They capture common use cases with web forms.\n\n            \n      \n      \nArray\n    \nIt checks if the the given value is an array, and iterates through its elements to perform checks on each of them.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { each { int? } } }\n\n\nThis example checks if codes is an array and if all the elements are integers, whereas the following example checks there are a minimum of 2 elements and all elements are strings.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { min_size?(2) & each { str? } } }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEmptiness\n    \nIt checks if the given value is empty or not. It is designed to works with strings and collections (array and hash).\nrequired(:tags) { empty? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEquality\n    \nThis predicate tests if the input is equal to a given value.\nrequired(:magic_number) { eql?(23) }\n\n\nRuby types are respected: 23 (an integer) is only equal to 23, and not to \"23\" (a string). See Type Safety section.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExclusion\n    \nIt checks if the input is not included by a given collection. This collection can be an array, a set, a range or any object that responds to #include?.\nrequired(:genre) { excluded_from?(%w(pop dance)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFormat\n    \nThis is a predicate that works with a regular expression to match it against data input.\nrequire 'uri'\nHTTP_FORMAT = URI.regexp(%w(http https))\n\nrequired(:url) { format?(HTTP_FORMAT) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than\n    \nThis predicate works with numbers to check if input is greater than a given threshold.\nrequired(:age) { gt?(18) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than Equal\n    \nThis is an open boundary variation of gt?. It checks if an input is greater than or equal of a given number.\nrequired(:age) { gteq?(19) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInclusion\n    \nThis predicate is the opposite of #exclude?: it verifies if the input is included in the given collection.\nrequired(:genre) { included_in?(%w(rock folk)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than\n    \nThis is the complement of #gt?: it checks for less than numbers.\nrequired(:age) { lt?(7) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than Equal\n    \nSimilarly to #gteq?, this is the open bounded version of #lt?: an input is valid if itâ€™s less than or equal to a number.\nrequired(:age) { lteq?(6) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nItâ€™s a predicate that ensures data input is filled, that means not nil or blank (\"\") or empty (in case we expect a collection).\nrequired(:name) { filled? }      # string\nrequired(:languages) { filled? } # collection\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMinimum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at least of the specified value.\nrequired(:password) { min_size?(12) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaximum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at max of the specified value.\nrequired(:name) { max_size?(128) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNone\n    \nThis verifies if the given input is nil. Blank strings (\"\") wonâ€™t pass this test and return false.\nrequired(:location) { none? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSize\n    \nIt checks if the size of input data is: a) exactly the same of a given quantity or b) it falls into a range.\nrequired(:two_factor_auth_code) { size?(6) }     # exact\nrequired(:password)             { size?(8..32) } # range\n\n\nThe check works with strings and collections.\nrequired(:answers) { size?(2) } # only 2 answers are allowed\n\n\nThis predicate works with objects that respond to #size. Until now we have seen strings and arrays being analysed by this validation, but there is another interesting usage: files.\n\nWhen a user uploads a file, the web server sets an instance of Tempfile, which responds to #size. That means we can validate the weight in bytes of file uploads.\nMEGABYTE = 1024 ** 2\n\nrequired(:avatar) { size?(1..(5 * MEGABYTE)) }\n\n","url":"/guides/1.0/validations/boolean-logic/"},"161":{"title":"Guides - Custom Predicates","content":"      \n      \n      \nCustom Predicates\n    \nWe have seen that built-in predicates as an expressive tool to get our job done with common use cases.\n\nBut what if our case is not common?

View Layouts","content":"      \n      \n      \nLayouts\n    \nLayouts are special views, that render the \"fixed\" part of the HTML markup.\nThis is the part that doesn't change from page to page (perhaps navigation, sidebar, header, footer, etc.)\n\nWhen we generate a new application, there is a default layout called Web::Views::ApplicationLayout with a apps/web/templates/application.html.erb template.\nIt comes with a very basic HTML5 wireframe.\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <%= yield %>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThe most interesting part is <%= yield %>.\nIt's replaced at the runtime with the output of a view.\nThe order for rendering is first the view, and then the layout.\n\nThe context for a layout template is made of the layout and the current view.\nThe latter has higher priority.\n\nImagine having the following line <title><%= page_title %></title>.\nIf both the layout and the view implement page_title, Hanami will use the one from the view.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfigure Layout\n    \nThe default layout is defined in an application's configuration.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      layout :application\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nHanami transforms the layout name in the application's configuration, by appending the Layout suffix. For example, layout :application corresponds to Web::Views::ApplicationLayout.\n\n\nIf we want to disable a layout for a view, we can use a DSL for that:\n# apps/web/views/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n    layout false\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we want to turn off this feature entirely, we can set layout nil into the application's configuration.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Multiple Template Layouts\n    \nSometimes it's useful to have more than one layout.\nFor example, if the application.html.erb template contains navigation elements, and we want an entirely different layout, without navigation elements, for a login page, we can create a login.html.erb layout template.\n\nAssuming we have a Web::Actions::UserSessions::New action to log a user in, we can create a login.html.erb template right next to the default application.html.erb in apps/web/templates/.\n\nThen we need to create a new Web::Views::LoginLayout class, which will use the new layout template. This file can be named app/web/views/login_layout.rb(right next to the default application_layout.rb):\nmodule Web\n  module Views\n    class LoginLayout\n      include Web::Layout\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow, in our app/web/views/user_sessions/new.rb we can specify you'd like to use the login layout for this View:\nmodule Web::Views::UserSessions\n  class New\n    include Web::View\n    layout :login\n  end\nend\n\n\nAnd we can add layout :login to any other View in this app that should use this same layout.\n\n            \n      \n      \nOptional Content\n    \nSometimes it's useful to render content only on certain pages.\nFor example, this could be used to have page-specific javascript.\n\nGiven the following template for a layout:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <!-- ... -->\n  <body>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <footer>\n      <%= local :javascript %>\n    </footer>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nWith following views:\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\nand\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Show\n    include Web::View\n\n    def javascript\n      raw %(<script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script>)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe first view doesn't respond to #javascript, so it safely ignores it.\nOur second object (Web::Views::Books::Show) responds to that method, so the result will be included in the final markup.\n","url":"/guides/1.0/views/layouts/"},"166":{"title":"Guides - MIME Types","content":"      \n      \n      \nMIME Types\n    \nA view can handle several MIME Types.

It also prevents gigantic controllers.\nIt has several advantages in terms of testability and control of an action.\n\n            \n      \n      \nA Simple Action\n    \nHanami ships with a generator for actions. Let's create a new one:\nhanami generate action web dashboard#index\n\n\nLet's examine the action:\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNaming\n    \nThat file begins with a module declaration.\n\nThe first token is the name of our application: Web.\nHanami can run multiple applications within the same Ruby process.\nThey are located under apps/.\nTheir name is used as a top-level module to contain inner components like actions and views, in order to avoid naming collisions.\nIf we have another action Home::Index under an application Admin, the two of them can coexist inside the same codebase.\n\nThe second token is a conventional name: Controllers.\nAll the controllers are nested under it.\nThis module is generated at runtime for us, when the application starts.\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, controllers are available under Web::Controllers.\n\n\nThe last bit is Dashboard, which is our controller.\n\nThe whole action name is Web::Controllers::Dashboard::Index.\n\n\n  You should avoid giving your action modules the same name as your application, e.g. avoid naming a controller Web in an app named Web. If you have a controller name like Web::Controllers::Web then some code across your app will break with errors about constants not being found, for example in views which include Web::Layout. This is because Ruby starts constant lookup with the current module, so a constant like Web::Layout referenced by code in the Web::Controllers::Web or Web::Controllers::Web::MyAction module will be converted to Web::Controllers::Web::Layout, which can't be found and causes a constant lookup error.\n\n\n\n  If you absolutely must name a controller with the same name as your application, you'll need to explicitly set the namespace lookup for things which should be included from immediately under the app, not the controller by prefixing those names with ::, e.g. change your views to include ::Web::Layout instead of include Web::Layout, and using include ::Web::Action in your controllers.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nÂ Action Module\n    \nHanami philosophy emphasizes composition over inheritance and avoids the framework superclass antipattern.\nFor this reason, all the components are provided as modules to include instead of base classes to inherit from.\n\nLike we said before, Hanami can run multiple apps within the same Ruby process.\nEach of them has its own configuration.\nTo keep separated actions from an application named Web and an application named Admin, we include Web::Action and Admin::Action respectively.\n\nIn our example, we have a directive include Web::Action.\nThat means our action will behave according to the configuration of the Web application.\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the action mixin to include is Web::Action.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nWhen we include Web::Action, we made our object compliant with Hanami::Controller's actions.\nWe need to implement #call, which is a method that accepts only one argument: params.\nThat is the object that carries the payload that comes from incoming HTTP requests from the router.\n\nThis interface reminds us of Rack.\nIndeed, our action is compatible with the Rack protocol.\n","url":"/guides/1.1/actions/overview/"},"179":{"title":"Guides - Action Parameters","content":"      \n      \n      \nParameters\n    \nParameters are taken from the Rack env and passed as an argument to #call.\nThey are similar to a Ruby Hash, but they offer an expanded set of features.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nParams can come from:\n\n\nRouter variables (eg. /books/:id)\nQuery string (eg. /books?title=Hanami)\nRequest body (eg. a POST request to /books)\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAccess\n    \nTo access the value of a param, we can use the subscriber operator #[].\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      self.body = \"Query string: #{ params[:q] }\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we visit /dashboard?q=foo, we should see Query string: foo.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSymbol Access\n    \nParams and nested params can be referenced only via symbols.\nparams[:q]\nparams[:book][:title]\n\n\nNow, what happens if the parameter :book is missing from the request?\nBecause params[:book] is nil, we can't access :title.\nIn this case Ruby will raise a NoMethodError.\n\nWe have a safe solution for our problem: #get.\nIt accepts a list of symbols, where each symbol represents a level in our nested structure.\nparams.get(:book, :title)             #

For this, you can use exposures method for getting all flash data.\n\nThe following test example uses this method.\n# spec/web/controllers/users/create_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/create'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Users::Create do\n  let(:action)  { Web::Controllers::Users::Create.new }\n  let(:user_params) { name: 'Luca' }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: user_params)\n    flash = action.exposures[:flash]\n\n    flash[:info].must_equal 'User was successfully created'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nRequests Tests\n    \nUnit tests are a great tool to assert that low level interfaces work as expected.\nWe always advise combining them with integration tests.\n\nIn the case of Hanami web applications, we can write features (aka acceptance tests) with Capybara, but what do we use when we are building HTTP APIs?\nThe tool that we suggest is rack-test.\n\nImagine we have an API application mounted at /api/v1 in our Hanami::Container.\n# config/environment.rb\n# ...\nHanami::Container.configure do\n  mount ApiV1::Application, at: '/api/v1'\n  mount Web::Application,   at: '/'\nend\n\n\nThen we have the following action.\n# apps/api_v1/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule ApiV1::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include ApiV1::Action\n    accept :json\n\n    def call(params)\n      user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])\n      self.body = JSON.generate(user.to_h)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this case we don't care too much about the internal state of the action, but about the output visible to the external world.\nThis is why we haven't set user as an instance variable and why we haven't exposed it.\n# spec/api_v1/requests/users_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe \"API V1 users\" do\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\n\n  before do\n    @user = UserRepository.new.create(name: 'Luca')\n  end\n\n  # app is required by Rack::Test\n  def app\n    Hanami.app\n  end\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    get \"/api/v1/users/#{ @user.id }\"\n\n    last_response.must_be :ok?\n    last_response.body.must_equal(JSON.generate(@user.to_h))\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nPlease avoid test doubles when writing full integration tests, as we want to verify that the whole stack is behaving as expected.\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/actions/testing/"},"185":{"title":"Architecture - Interactors","content":"      \n      \n      \nOverview\n    \nHanami provides an optional tool for organizing your code.\n\nThese are Interactors,\nalso referred to service objects, use-cases or operations\n\nWe think they're great and help manage complexity,\nbut you're free to build a Hanami app without them at all.\n\nIn this guide, we'll explain how Hanami's Interactors work by adding a small feature to an existing application.\n\nThe existing application we'll work from is the bookshelf application\nfrom the Getting Started Guide.\n\n            \n      \n      \nA New Feature: Email Notifications\n    \nThe story for our new feature is:\n\n\nAs an administrator, I want to receive an email notification when a book is added\n\n\nSince the application doesn't have authentication, anyone can add a new book.\nWe'll provide an admin email address via an environment variable.\n\nThis is just an example to show when you should use an interactor, and,\nspecifically, how Hanami::Interactor can be used.\n\nThis example could provide a basis for other features like\nadding administrator approval of new books before they're posted,\nor allowing users to provide an email address, then edit the book via a special link.\n\nIn practice,\nyou can use interactors to implement any business logic,\nabstracted away from the web.\nIt's particularly useful for when you want to do several things at once,\nin order to manage the complexity of the codebase.\n\nThey're used to isolate non-trivial business logic.\nThis follows the Single Responsibility Principle\n\nIn a web application, they will generally be called from the controller action.\nThis lets you separate concerns.\nYour business logic objects, interactors, won't know about the web at all.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCallbacks? We Don't Need No Stinkin' Callbacks!\n    \nAn easy way of implementing email notification would be to add a callback.\n\nThat is: after a new Book record is created in the database, an email is sent out.\n\nBy design, Hanami doesn't provide any such mechanism.\nThis is because we consider persistence callbacks an anti-pattern.\nThey violate the Single Responsibility principle.\nIn this case, they improperly mix persistence with email notifications.\n\nDuring testing (and at some other point, most likely),\nyou'll want to skip that callback.\nThis quickly becomes confusing,\nsince multiple callbacks on the same event will be triggered in a specific order.\nAlso, you may want to skip several callbacks at some point.\nThey make code hard to understand, and brittle.\n\nInstead, we recommend being explicit over implicit.\n\nAn interactor is an object that represents a specific use-case.\n\nThey let each class have a single responsibility.\nAn interactor's single responsibility is to combine object and method calls in order to achieve a specific outcome.\n\nWe provide Hanami::Interactor as a module,\nso you can start with a Plain Old Ruby Object,\nand include include Hanami::Interactor when you need some of its features.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConcept\n    \nThe central idea behind interactors is that you extract an isolated piece of functionality into a new class.\n\nYou should only write two public methods: initialize and call.\n\nThis means objects are easy to reason about,\nsince there's only one possible method to call after the object is created.\n\nBy encapsulating behavior into a single object, it's easier to test.\nIt also makes your codebase easier to understand,\nrather than leaving your complexity hidden, only expressed implicitly.\n\n            \n      \n      \nPreparing\n    \nLet's say we have our bookshelf application,\nfrom the Getting Started\nand we want to add the 'email notification for added book' feature.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCreating Our Interactor\n    \nLet's create a folder for our interactors, and a folder for their specs:\n% mkdir lib/bookshelf/interactors\n% mkdir spec/bookshelf/interactors\n\n\nWe put them in lib/bookshelf because they're decoupled from the web application.\nLater, you may want to add books via an admin portal, an API, or even a command-line utility.\n\nLet's call our interactor AddBook,\nand write a new spec spec/bookshelf/interactors/add_book_spec.rb:\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe AddBook do\n  let(:interactor) { AddBook.new }\n\n  it \"succeeds\" do\n    expect(interactor.call).to be_a_success\n  end\nend\n\n\n(Note: Hanami has no specific RSpec integrations,\nthis expectation works because Hanami::Interactor defines a success? class,\nwhich RSpec lets us delegate to with be_a_success\n\nRunning your test suite will cause a NameError because there is no AddBook class.\nLet's create that class in a lib/bookshelf/interactors/add_book.rb file:\nrequire 'hanami/interactor'\n\nclass AddBook\n  include Hanami::Interactor\n\n  def initialize\n    # set up the object\n  end\n\n  def call(book_attributes)\n    # get it done\n  end\nend\n\n\nThese are the only two public methods this class should ever have:\ninitialize, to set-up the data, and\ncall to actually fulfill the use-case.\n\nThese methods, especially call, should call private methods that you'll write.\n\nBy default, the result is considered a success,\nsince we didn't say that it explicitly say it failed.\n\nLet's run this test:\n% bundle exec rake\n\n\nAll the tests should pass!\n\nNow, let's make our AddBook interactor actually do something!\n\n            \n      \n      \nCreating a Book\n    \nEdit spec/bookshelf/interactors/add_book_spec.rb:\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe AddBook do\n  let(:interactor) { AddBook.new }\n  let(:attributes) { Hash[author: \"James Baldwin\", title: \"The Fire Next Time\"] }\n\n  describe \"good input\" do\n    let(:result) { interactor.call(attributes) }\n\n    it \"succeeds\" do\n      expect(result).to be_a_success\n    end\n\n    it \"creates a Book with correct title and author\" do\n      expect(result.book.title).to eq(\"The Fire Next Time\")\n      expect(result.book.author).to eq(\"James Baldwin\")\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf you run the tests with bundle exec rake, you'll see this error:\nruby\nNoMethodError: undefined method `book' for #<Hanami::Interactor::Result:0x007f94498c1718>\n\n\nLet's fill out our interactor,\nthen explain what we did:\nrequire 'hanami/interactor'\n\nclass AddBook\n  include Hanami::Interactor\n\n  expose :book\n\n  def initialize\n    # set up the object\n  end\n\n  def call(book_attributes)\n    @book = Book.new(book_attributes)\n  end\nend\n\n\nThere are two important things to note here:\n\nThe expose :book line exposes the @book instance variable as a method on the result that will be returned.\n\nThe call method assigns a new Book entity to the @book variable, which will be exposed to the result.\n\nThe tests should pass now.\n\nWe've initialized a new Book entity, but it's not persisted to the database.\n\n            \n      \n      \nPersisting the Book\n    \nWe have a new Book built from the title and author passed in,\nbut it doesn't exist in the database yet.\n\nWe need to use our BookRepository to persist it.\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe AddBook do\n  let(:interactor) { AddBook.new }\n  let(:attributes) { Hash[author: \"James Baldwin\", title: \"The Fire Next Time\"] }\n\n  describe \"good input\" do\n    let(:result) { interactor.call(attributes) }\n\n    it \"succeeds\" do\n      expect(result).to be_a_success\n    end\n\n    it \"creates a Book with correct title and author\" do\n      expect(result.book.title).to eq(\"The Fire Next Time\")\n      expect(result.book.author).to eq(\"James Baldwin\")\n    end\n\n    it \"persists the Book\" do\n      expect(result.book.id).to_not be_nil\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf you run the tests,\nyou'll see the new expectation fails with Expected nil to not be nil.\n\nThis is because the book we built doesn't have an id,\nsince it only gets one if and when it is persisted.\n\nTo make this test pass, we'll need to create a persisted Book instead.\n(Another, equally valid, option would be to persist the Book we already have.)\n\nEdit the call method in our lib/bookshelf/interactors/add_book.rb interactor:\n  def call\n    @book = BookRepository.new.create(book_attributes)\n  end\n\n\nInstead of calling Book.new,\nwe create a new BookRepository and send create to it, with our attributes.\n\nThis still returns a Book, but it also persists this record to the database.\n\nIf you run the tests now you'll see all the tests pass.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDependency Injection\n    \nLet's refactor our implementation though,\nto leverage Dependency Injection\n\nWe recommend you use Dependency Injection, but you don't have to.\nThis is an entirely optional feature of Hanami::Interactor.\n\nThe spec so far works,\nbut it relies on the behavior of the Repository\n(that the id method is defined after persistence succeeds).\nThat is an implementation detail of how the Repository works.\nFor example, if you wanted to create a UUID before it's persisted,\nand signify the persistence was successful in some other way than populating an id column,\nyou'd have to modify this spec.\n\nWe can change our spec and our interactor to make it more robust:\nit'll be less likely to break because of changes outside of its file.\n\nHere's how we can use Dependency Injection in our interactor:\nrequire 'hanami/interactor'\n\nclass AddBook\n  include Hanami::Interactor\n\n  expose :book\n\n  def initialize(repository: BookRepository.new)\n    @repository = repository\n  end\n\n  def call(book_attributes)\n    @book = @repository.create(book_attributes)\n  end\nend\n\n\nIt's basically the same thing, with a little bit more code,\nto create the @repository instance variable.\n\nRight now, our spec tests the behavior of the repository,\nby checking to make sure id is populated\n(expect(result.book.id).to_not be_nil).\n\nThis is an implementation detail.\n\nInstead, we can change our spec to merely make sure the repository receives the create message,\nand trust that the repository will persist it (since that is its responsibility).\n\nLet's change remove our it \"persists the Book\" expectation and\ncreate a describe \"persistence\" block:\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe AddBook do\n  let(:interactor) { AddBook.new }\n  let(:attributes) { Hash[author: \"James Baldwin\", title: \"The Fire Next Time\"] }\n\n  describe \"good input\" do\n    let(:result) { interactor.call(attributes) }\n\n    it \"succeeds\" do\n      expect(result).to be_a_success\n    end\n\n    it \"creates a Book with correct title and author\" do\n      expect(result.book.title).to eq(\"The Fire Next Time\")\n      expect(result.book.author).to eq(\"James Baldwin\")\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe \"persistence\" do\n    let(:repository) { instance_double(\"BookRepository\") }\n\n    it \"persists the Book\" do\n      expect(repository).to receive(:create)\n      AddBook.new(repository: repository).call(attributes)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow our test doesn't violate the boundaries of the concern.\n\nWhat we did here is inject our interactor's dependency on the repository.\nNote: in our non-test code, we don't need to change anything.\nThe default value for the repository: keyword argument provides a new repository object if one is not passed in.\n\n            \n      \n      \nEmail Notification\n    \nLet's add the email notification!\n\nYou can use a different library,\nbut we'll use Hanami::Mailer.\n(You could do anything here, like send an SMS, send a chat message, or call a webhook.)\n% bundle exec hanami generate mailer book_added_notification\n      create  lib/bookshelf/mailers/book_added_notification.rb\n      create  spec/bookshelf/mailers/book_added_notification_spec.rb\n      create  lib/bookshelf/mailers/templates/book_added_notification.txt.erb\n      create  lib/bookshelf/mailers/templates/book_added_notification.html.erb\n\n\nWe won't get into the details of how the mailer works,\nbut it's pretty simple: there's a Hanami::Mailer class, an associated spec,\nand two templates (one for plaintext, and one for html).\n\nWe'll keep our templates empty,\nso the emails will be blank,\nwith a subject line saying 'Book added!'.\n\nEdit the mailer spec spec/bookshelf/mailers/book_added_notification_spec.rb:\nRSpec.describe Mailers::BookAddedNotification, type: :mailer do\n  subject { Mailers::BookAddedNotification }\n\n  before { Hanami::Mailer.deliveries.clear }\n\n  it 'has correct `from` email address' do\n    expect(subject.from).to eq(\"no-reply@example.com\")\n  end\n\n  it 'has correct `to` email address' do\n    expect(subject.to).to eq(\"admin@example.com\")\n  end\n\n  it 'has correct `subject`' do\n    expect(subject.subject).to eq(\"Book added!\")\n  end\n\n  it 'delivers mail' do\n    expect {\n      subject.deliver\n    }.to change { Hanami::Mailer.deliveries.length }.by(1)\n  end\nend\n\n\nAnd edit the mailer lib/bookshelf/mailers/book_added_notification.rb:\nclass Mailers::BookAddedNotification\n  include Hanami::Mailer\n\n  from    'no-reply@example.com'\n  to      'admin@example.com'\n  subject 'Book added!'\nend\n\n\nNow all our tests should pass!\n\nBut, this Mailer isn't called from anywhere.\nWe need to call this Mailer from our AddBook interactor.\n\nLet's edit our AddBook spec, to ensure our mailer is called:\n  ...\n  describe \"sending email\" do\n    let(:mailer) { instance_double(\"Mailers::BookAddedNotification\") }\n\n    it \"send :deliver to the mailer\" do\n      expect(mailer).to receive(:deliver)\n      AddBook.new(mailer: mailer).call(attributes)\n    end\n  end\n  ...\n\n\nRunning your test suite will show an error: ArgumentError: unknown keyword: mailer.\nThis makes sense, since our interactor has only a singular keyword argument: repository.\n\nLet's integrate our mailer now,\nby adding a new mailer keyword argument on the initializer.\n\nWe'll also call deliver on our new @mailer instance variable.\nrequire 'hanami/interactor'\n\nclass AddBook\n  include Hanami::Interactor\n\n  expose :book\n\n  def initialize(repository: BookRepository.new, mailer: Mailers::BookAddedNotification.new)\n    @repository = repository\n    @mailer = mailer\n  end\n\n  def call(book_attributes)\n    @book = @repository.create(book_attributes)\n    @mailer.deliver\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow our interactor will deliver an email, notifying that a book has been added.\n\n            \n      \n      \nIntegrating With Our Controller\n    \nFinally, we need to call this interactor from our action.\n\nEdit the action file, apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb:\n  def call(params)\n    if params.valid?\n      @book = AddBook.new.call(params[:book])\n\n      redirect_to routes.books_path\n    else\n      self.status = 422\n    end\n  end\n\n\nOur specs will still pass, but there's a small problem.\n\nWe're testing the book creation code twice.\n\nThis is generally bad practice, and we can fix it,\nby illustrating another benefit of interactors.\n\nWe're going to use Dependency Injection again.\nThis time, in our action.\n\nWe'll add a initialize method,\nwith a keyword argument for interactor.\n\nBut first, let's the spec spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb.\n\nWe're going to remove references to BookRepository,\nand leverage a double for our AddBook interactor:\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\nRSpec.describe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:interactor) { instance_double('AddBook', call: nil) }\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new(interactor: interactor) }\n\n  describe 'with valid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' }] }\n\n    it 'calls interactor' do\n      expect(interactor).to receive(:call)\n      response = action.call(params)\n    end\n\n    it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n\n      expect(response[0]).to eq(302)\n      expect(response[1]['Location']).to eq('/books')\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'with invalid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: {}] }\n\n    it 'calls interactor' do\n      expect(interactor).to receive(:call)\n      response = action.call(params)\n    end\n\n    it 're-renders the books#new view' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n      expect(response[0]).to eq(422)\n    end\n\n    it 'sets errors attribute accordingly' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n\n      expect(action.params.errors[:book][:title]).to eq(['is missing'])\n      expect(action.params.errors[:book][:author]).to eq(['is missing'])\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe test will cause an error,\nbecause we haven't overridden our initialize.\nLet's do that now,\nand leverage our new instance variable in the call method:\n  ...\n  def initialize(interactor: AddBook.new)\n    @interactor = interactor\n  end\n\n  def call(params)\n    if params.valid?\n      @book = @interactor.call(params[:book])\n\n      redirect_to routes.books_path\n    else\n      self.status = 422\n    end\n  end\n  ...\n\n\nNow our specs pass, and they're much more robust!\n\nOur action now has less responsibility;\nit delegates its real behavior to our interactor.\n\nThe action takes input (from parameters),\nand calls our interactor to actually do its work.\nIt's single responsibility is to deal with the web.\nOur interactor now deals with our actual business logic.\n\nThis is a great relief for our action and its spec.\n\nOur action is largely liberated from our business logic.\n\nWhen we modify our interactor,\nwe do not have to modify our action, or its spec.\n\n(Note that in a real app, you'll likely want to do more than our logic above,\nlike make sure the result is a success.\nElse, if it's a failure, you'll want to pass along errors from the interactor.)\n\n            \n      \n      \nInteractor parts\n    \n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nThe interface is rather simple, as shown above.\nThere's also one more method you can (optionally) implement.\nIt's a private method named valid?.\n\nBy default valid? returns true.\nIf you define valid? and it ever returns false,\nthen call will never be executed.\n\nInstead, the result will be returned immediately.\nThis also causes the result to be a failure (instead of a success.)\n\nYou can read about it in the\nAPI documentation\n\n            \n      \n      \nResult\n    \nThe result of Hanami::Interactor#call is a Hanami::Interactor::Result object.\n\nIt will have accessor methods defined for whatever instance variables you expose.\n\nIt also has the ability to keep track of errors.\n\nIn your interactor, you can call error with a message,\nto add an error.\nThis automatically makes the resulting object a failure.\n\n(There's also an error! method,\nwhich does the same and also interrupts the flow,\nstopping the interactor from executing more code).\n\nYou can access the errors on the resulting object, by calling .errors.\n\nYou can read more about the Result object

between the core of our product and the delivery mechanisms.\nThe first is expressed by the set of use cases that our product implements, while the latter are interfaces to make these features available to the outside world.\n\nWhen we generate a new project we can find two important directories: lib/ and apps/.\nThey are home to the main parts described above.\n\n            \n      \n      \nApplication Core\n    \nWe implement a set of functionalities, without worrying about how they can be exposed to the outside world.\nThis is the cornerstone of our product, and we want to be careful on how we manage dependencies for it.\n\nHanami::Model is the default choice for persisting our Ruby objects.\nThis is a soft-dependency, it can be removed from our Gemfile and replaced with something else.\n\nLet's have a look at how the lib/ directory appears for a new generated project called bookshelf that uses Hanami::Model.\n% tree lib\nlib\nâ”œâ”€â”€ bookshelf\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€

like a Ruby gem.\n\nThe lib/bookshelf.rb file is the entry point for our application, when we require this file, we require and initialize all the code under lib/.\n\nThere are two important directories:\n\n\nlib/bookshelf/entities\nlib/bookshelf/repositories\n\n\nThey contain entities that are Ruby objects at the core of our model domain, and they aren't aware of any persistence mechanism.\nFor this purpose we have a separate concept, repositories, which are a mediator between our entities and the underlying database.\n\nFor each entity named Book we can have a BookRepository.\n\nWe can add as many directories that we want, such as lib/bookshelf/interactors to implement our use cases.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDelivery Mechanisms\n    \nHanami generates a default application named Web, which lives under apps/web.\nThis application depends on the core of our product, as it uses entities, repositories and all the other objects defined there.\n\nIt's used as web delivery mechanism, for our features.\n% tree apps/web\napps/web\nâ”œâ”€â”€ application.rb\nâ”œâ”€â”€ assets\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€

application.html.erb\nâ””â”€â”€ views\n    â””â”€â”€ application_layout.rb\n\n8 directories, 5 files\n\n\nLet's have a quick look at this code.\n\nThe file apps/web/application.rb contains a Hanami application named Web::Application, here we can configure all the settings for this component of our project.\nDirectories such as apps/web/controllers, views and templates will contain our actions, views and templates.\n\nWeb assets such as javascripts and stylesheets will be automatically served by the application.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMonolith First\n    \nOur default application Web can be used as a UI interface for our customers.\nAt a certain point in our story, we want to manage our users with an admin panel.\n\nWe know that the set of features that we're going to introduce doesn't belong to our main UI (Web).\nOn the other hand, it's too early for us to implement a microservices architecture, only for the purpose of helping our users reset their password.\n\nHanami has a solution for our problem: we can generate a new app that lives in the same Ruby process, but it's a separated component.\n% bundle exec hanami generate app admin\n\n\nThis command MUST be run from the root of our project. It will generate a new application (Admin::Application) under apps/admin.\n\nIn the late stages of our product life-cycle, we could decide to extract this into a standalone component.\nWe would just need to move everything under apps/admin into another repository and deploy it separately.\n\n            \n      \n      \nAnatomy Of A Project\n    \nWe have already examined lib/ and apps/, but there are other parts of a newly generated project that deserve to be explained.\n% tree -L 1\n.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile.lock\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Rakefile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ apps\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config.ru\nâ”œâ”€â”€ db\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ””â”€â”€ spec\n\n\nLet's quickly introduce them:\n\n\nGemfile and Gemfile.lock are Bundler artifacts\nRakefile describes Rake task for our project.\nconfig/ contains an important file config/environment.rb, which is the entry point for our project.\nBy requiring it, we'll preload our dependencies (Ruby gems), Hanami frameworks and our code.\nconfig.ru is a file that describes how a Rack server must run our applications.\ndb/ contains database files (for File System adapter or SQLite).\nWhen our project uses a SQL database it also contains db/migrations and db/schema.sql.\nspec/ contains unit and acceptance tests.\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/architecture/overview/"},"187":{"title":"Guides - Assets Compressors","content":"      \n      \n      \nAssets\n    \n            \n      \n      \nCompressors\n    \nAssets compression (aka minification) is a process to shrink the file size of a file in order to reduce the time that a browser needs to download it.\nUsually, it's applied to javascripts and stylesheets.\n\nIn order to set one of the following engines, we need to open apps/web/application.rb and write:\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      assets do\n        javascript_compressor :builtin\n        stylesheet_compressor :builtin\n\n        # ...\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we want to skip compression, just comment one or both the lines above.\n\n            \n      \n      \nJavaScript\n    \nWe support the following engines:\n\n\n:builtin - It isn't efficient like the other algorithms, but it's a good starting point because it's written in pure Ruby and it doesn't require external dependencies.\n:yui - It's based on Yahoo!

For instance, Heroku requires Ruby web apps to serve static assets.\nTo enable this feature in production, just make sure that this special environment variable is set to true (in .env or .env.production).\n\n            \n      \n      \nWhat Does It Mean To Serve Static Assets With Hanami?\n    \nAs mentioned above, when this feature is enabled, a special middleware is added in front of the project Rack stack: Hanami::Static.\n\nIncoming requests can generate the following use cases\n\n            \n      \n      \nFresh Asset\n    GET /assets/application.js\n\n\nIt copies the apps/web/assets/javascripts/application.js to public/assets/application.js and then serves it.\n\n\n  Assets are copied only if the destination path does NOT exist (eg. public/assets/application.js).\n  If it DOES exist, the asset is only served, without copying it.\n\n\n\n  When an application has turned OFF asset compilation (Compile mode), Hanami won't copy the file.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nStale Asset\n    \nThis could happen in development mode. When we require an asset the first time it gets copied to the public/ directory. Then when we edit the source file, the destination file becomes stale.\nGET /assets/application.js\n# edit the original file: apps/web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n# then require it again\nGET /assets/application.js\n\n\nIt copies the source into the destination file again (public/assets/application.js) and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrecompiled Asset\n    \nLet's say we use Sass to write our stylesheets.\nGET /assets/application.css\n\n\nIt preprocess the apps/web/assets/stylesheet/application.css.sass to public/assets/application.css and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDynamic Resource\n    GET /books/23\n\n\nThis isn't a static file available under public/, so the control passes to the backend that hits the appropriate action.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMissing Resource\n    GET /unknown\n\n\nThis isn't a static file or a dynamic resource, the project returns a 404 (Not Found).\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nEach application has a separated set of directories where its assets can be found.\nAssets are recursively searched under these paths.\n\nNew projects have a default directory where application assets can be put:\n% tree apps/web/assets\napps/web/assets\nâ”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico\nâ”œâ”€â”€ images\nâ”œâ”€â”€ javascripts\nâ””â”€â”€ stylesheets\n\n3 directories, 1 file\n\n\nWe can add as many directories we want under it (eg. apps/web/assets/fonts).\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the default asset directory is apps/web/assets\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAdding Sources\n    \nIf we want add other sources for a given application, we can specify them in the configuration.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      # ...\n      assets do\n        # apps/web/assets is added by default\n        sources << [\n          'vendor/assets'\n        ]\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis will add apps/web/vendor/assets and all its subdirectories.\n\n\n  Hanami looks recursively through the asset sources.

If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable web applications, you're in good hands.\n  \n\n  \n    Hanami is built for people like you.\n  \n\n  \n    I warn you that whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer this learning process can be hard.\n    Over time, we build expectations about how things should be, and it can be painful to change. But without change, there is no challenge and without challenge, there is no growth.\n  \n\n  \n    Sometimes a feature doesn't look right, that doesn't mean it's you.\n    It can be a matter of formed habits, a design fallacy or even a bug.\n  \n\n  \n    Myself and the rest of the Community are putting best efforts to make Hanami better every day.\n  \n\n  \n    In this guide we will set up our first Hanami project and build a simple bookshelf web application.\n    We'll touch on all the major components of Hanami framework, all guided by tests.\n  \n\n  \n    If you feel alone, or frustrated, don't give up, jump in our chat and ask for help.\n    There will be someone more than happy to talk with you.\n  \n\n  \n    Enjoy,\n    Luca Guidi\n    Hanami creator\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrerequisites\n    \nBefore we get started, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.\nFirst, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.\n\nYou should also be familiar with Bundler, Rake, working with a terminal and building apps using the Model, View, Controller paradigm.\n\nLastly, in this guide we'll be using a SQLite database.\nIf you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCreate a New Hanami Project\n    \nTo create a new Hanami project, we need to install the Hanami gem from Rubygems.\nThen we can use the new hanami executable to generate a new project:\n% gem install hanami\n% hanami new bookshelf\n\n\n\n  By default, the project will be setup to use a SQLite database. For real-world projects, you can specify your engine:\n  \n  % hanami new bookshelf --database=postgres\n Â \n\n\nThis will create a new directory bookshelf in our current location.\nLet's see what it contains:\n% cd bookshelf\n% tree -L 1\n.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Rakefile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ apps\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config.ru\nâ”œâ”€â”€ db\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ”œâ”€â”€ public\nâ””â”€â”€ spec\n\n6 directories, 3 files\n\n\nHere's what we need to know:\n\n\nGemfile defines our Rubygems dependencies (using Bundler).\nRakefile describes our Rake tasks.\napps contains one or more web applications compatible with Rack.\nHere we can find the first generated Hanami application called Web.\nIt's the place where we find our controllers, views, routes and templates.\nconfig contains configuration files.\nconfig.ru is for Rack servers.\ndb contains our database schema and migrations.\nlib contains our business logic and domain model, including entities and repositories.\npublic will contain compiled static assets.\nspec contains our tests.\n\n\nGo ahead and install our gem dependency with Bundler; then we can launch a development server:\n% bundle install\n% bundle exec hanami server\n\n\nAnd... bask in the glory of your first Hanami project at\nhttp://localhost:2300! We should see a screen similar to this:\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Architecture\n    \nHanami architecture can host several Hanami (and Rack) applications in the same Ruby process.\n\nThese applications live under apps/.\nEach of them can be a component of our product, such as the user facing web interface, the admin pane, metrics, HTTP API etc..\n\nAll these parts are a delivery mechanism to the business logic that lives under lib/.\nThis is the place where our models are defined, and interact with each other to compose the features that our product provides.\n\nHanami architecture is heavily inspired by Clean Architecture.\n\n            \n      \n      \nWriting Our First Test\n    \nThe opening screen we see when we point our browser at our app, is a\ndefault page which is displayed when there are no routes defined.\n\nHanami encourages Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as a way to write web applications.\nIn order to get our first custom page to display, we'll write a high-level feature test:\n# spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Visit home' do\n  it 'is successful' do\n    visit '/'\n\n    page.body.must_include('Bookshelf')\n  end\nend\n\n\nNote that, although Hanami is ready for a Behavior Driven Development workflow out of the box, it is in no way bound to any particular testing framework -- nor does it come with special integrations or libraries.\n\nWe'll go with Minitest here (which is the default), but we can use RSpec by creating the project with --test=rspec option.\nHanami will then generate helpers and stub files for it.\n\n\n  Please check .env.test in case you need to tweak the database URL.\n\n\nWe have to migrate our schema in the test database by running:\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\nAs you can see, we have set HANAMI_ENV environment variable to instruct our command about the environment to use.\n\n            \n      \n      \nFollowing a Request\n    \nNow we have a test, we can see it fail:\n% bundle exec rake test\nRun options: --seed 44759\n\n# Running:\n\nF\n\nFinished in 0.018611s, 53.7305 runs/s, 53.7305 assertions/s.\n\n  1) Failure:\nHomepage#test_0001_is successful [/Users/hanami/bookshelf/spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb:6]:\nExpected \"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n  <head>\\n    <title>Not Found</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <h1>Not Found</h1>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n\" to include \"Bookshelf\".\n\n1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\nNow let's make it pass.\nLets add the code required to make this test pass, step-by-step.\n\nThe first thing we need to add is a route:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nroot to: 'home#index'\n\n\nWe pointed our application's root URL to the index action of the home controller (see the routing guide for more information).\nNow we can create the index action.\n# apps/web/controllers/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis is an empty action that doesn't implement any business logic.\nEach action has a corresponding view, which is a Ruby object and needs to be added in order to complete the request.\n# apps/web/views/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\n...which, in turn, is empty and does nothing more than render its template.\nThis is the file we need to edit in order to make our test pass. All we need to do is add the bookshelf heading.\n# apps/web/templates/home/index.html.erb\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n\n\nSave your changes, run your test again and it now passes. Great!\nRun options: --seed 19286\n\n# Running:\n\n.\n\nFinished in 0.011854s, 84.3600 runs/s, 168.7200 assertions/s.\n\n1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGenerating New Actions\n    \nLet's use our new knowledge about the major Hanami components to add a new action.\nThe purpose of our Bookshelf project is to manage books.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and let the user manage them with our project.\nA first step would be to show a listing of all the books in our system.\n\nLet's write a new feature test describing what we want to achieve:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe test is simple enough, and fails because the URL /books is not currently recognised in our application. We'll create a new controller action to fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Generators\n    \nHanami ships with various generators to save on typing some of the code involved in adding new functionality.\nIn our terminal, enter:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#index\n\n\nThis will generate a new action index in the books controller of the web application.\nIt gives us an empty action, view and template; it also adds a default route to apps/web/config/routes.rb:\nget '/books', to: 'books#index'\n\n\nIf you're using ZSH, you may get zsh: no matches found: books#index. In that case, you can use:\n\n% hanami generate action web books/index\n\n\nTo make our test pass, we need to edit our newly generated template file in apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb:\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<div id=\"books\">\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nSave your changes and see your tests pass! The output will also contain a skipped test. This is due to an autogenerated test in spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb.\n\nThe terminology of controllers and actions might be confusing, so let's clear this up: actions form the basis of our Hanami applications; controllers are mere modules that group several actions together.\nSo while the \"controller\" is conceptually present in our project, in practice we only deal with actions.\n\nWe've used a generator to create a new endpoint in our application.\nBut one thing you may have noticed is that our new template contains the same <h1> as our home/index.html.erb template.\nLet's fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nLayouts\n    \nTo avoid repeating ourselves in every single template, we can use a layout.\nOpen up the file apps/web/templates/application.html.erb and edit it to look like this:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Bookshelf</title>\n    <%= favicon %>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n    <%= yield %>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nNow you can remove the duplicate lines from the other templates. Let's run the tests again to check that everything worked fine.\n\nA layout is like any other template, but it is used to wrap your regular templates.\nThe yield line is replaced with the contents of our regular template.\nIt's the perfect place to put our repeating headers and footers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nModeling Our Data With Entities\n    \nHard-coding books in our templates is, admittedly, kind of cheating.\nLet's add some dynamic data to our application.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and display them on our page.\nTo do so, we need a way to read and write to our database.\nEnter entities and repositories:\n\n\nan entity is a domain object (eg. Book) uniquely identified by its identity.\na repository mediates between entities and the persistence layer.\n\n\nEntities are totally unaware of the database.\nThis makes them lightweight and easy to test.\n\nFor this reason we need a repository to persist the data that a Book depends on.\nRead more about entities and repositories in the models guide.\n\nHanami ships with a generator for models, so let's use it to create a Book entity and the corresponding repository:\n% bundle exec hanami generate model book\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb\ncreate  db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository_spec.rb\n\n\nThe generator gives us an entity, a repository, a migration, and accompanying test files.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMigrations To Change Our Database Schema\n    \nLet's modify the generated migration (the path to the migration will differ for you, because it contains a timestamp) to include title and author fields:\n# db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\n\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  change do\n    create_table :books do\n      primary_key :id\n\n      column :title,  String, null: false\n      column :author, String, null: false\n\n      column :created_at, DateTime, null: false\n      column :updated_at, DateTime, null: false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nHanami provides a DSL to describe changes to our database schema. You can read more\nabout how migrations work in the migrations' guide.\n\nIn this case, we define a new table with columns for each of our entities' attributes.\nLet's prepare our database for the development and test environments:\n% bundle exec hanami db prepare\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWorking With Entities\n    \nAn entity is something really close to a plain Ruby object.\nWe should focus on the behaviors that we want from it and only then, how to save it.\n\nFor now, we keep the generated entity class:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\nclass Book < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\nThis class will generate getters and setters for each attribute which we pass to initialize params.\nWe can verify it all works as expected with a unit test:\n# spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Book do\n  it 'can be initialized with attributes' do\n    book = Book.new(title: 'Refactoring')\n    book.title.must_equal 'Refactoring'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Repositories\n    \nNow we are ready to play around with our repository.\nWe can use Hanami's console command to launch IRb with our application pre-loaded, so we can use our objects:\n% bundle exec hanami console\n>> repository = BookRepository.new\n=> => #<BookRepository relations=[:books]>\n>> repository.all\n=> []\n>> book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab61c23b8 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n>> repository.find(book.id)\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab6181610 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n\n\nHanami repositories have methods to load one or more entities from our database; and to create and update existing records.\nThe repository is also the place where you would define new methods to implement custom queries.\n\nTo recap, we've seen how Hanami uses entities and repositories to model our data.\nEntities represent our behavior, while repositories use mappings to translate our entities to our data store.\nWe can use migrations to apply changes to our database schema.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Dynamic Data\n    \nWith our new experience modelling data, we can get to work displaying dynamic data on our book listing page.\nLet's adjust the feature test we created earlier:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    repository.create(title: 'PoEAA', author: 'Martin Fowler')\n    repository.create(title: 'TDD',   author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe create the required records in our test and then assert the correct number of book classes on the page.\nWhen we run this test it should pass. If it does not pass, a likely reason is that the test database was not migrated.\n\nNow we can go change our template and remove the static HTML.\nOur view needs to loop over all available records and render them.\nLet's write a test to force this change in our view:\n# spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::Index do\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[books: []] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::Index.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'exposes #books' do\n    view.books.must_equal exposures.fetch(:books)\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are no books' do\n    it 'shows a placeholder message' do\n      rendered.must_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are books' do\n    let(:book1)     { Book.new(title: 'Refactoring', author: 'Martin Fowler') }\n    let(:book2)     { Book.new(title: 'Domain Driven Design', author: 'Eric Evans') }\n    let(:exposures) { Hash[books: [book1, book2]] }\n\n    it 'lists them all' do\n      rendered.scan(/class=\"book\"/).count.must_equal 2\n      rendered.must_include('Refactoring')\n      rendered.must_include('Domain Driven Design')\n    end\n\n    it 'hides the placeholder message' do\n      rendered.wont_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify that our index page will show a simple placeholder message when there are no books to display; when there are, it lists every one of them.\nNote how rendering a view with some data is relatively straight-forward.\nHanami is designed around simple objects with minimal interfaces that are easy to test in isolation, yet still work great together.\n\nLet's rewrite our template to implement these requirements:\n# apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<% if books.any? %>\n  <div id=\"books\">\n    <% books.each do |book| %>\n      <div class=\"book\">\n        <h2><%= book.title %></h2>\n        <p><%= book.author %></p>\n      </div>\n    <% end %>\n  </div>\n<% else %>\n  <p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>\n<% end %>\n\n\nIf we run our feature test now, we'll see it fails â€” because our controller\naction does not actually expose the books to our view. We can write a test for\nthat change:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Index do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Index.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    @book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'is successful' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n    response[0].must_equal 200\n  end\n\n  it 'exposes all books' do\n    action.call(params)\n    action.exposures[:books].must_equal [@book]\n  end\nend\n\n\nWriting tests for controller actions is basically two-fold: you either assert on the response object, which is a Rack-compatible array of status, headers and content; or on the action itself, which will contain exposures after we've called it.\nNow we've specified that the action exposes :books, we can implement our action:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :books\n\n    def call(params)\n      @books = BookRepository.new.all\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nBy using the expose method in our action class, we can expose the contents of our @books instance variable to the outside world, so that Hanami can pass it to the view.\nThat's enough to make all our tests pass again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59133\n\n# Running:\n\n.........\n\nFinished in 0.042065s, 213.9543 runs/s, 380.3633 assertions/s.\n\n9 runs, 16 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nBuilding Forms To Create Records\n    \nOne of the last remaining steps is to make it possible to add new books to the system.\nThe plan is simple: we build a page with a form to enter details.\n\nWhen the user submits the form, we build a new entity, save it, and redirect the user back to the book listing.\nHere's that story expressed in a test:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  after do\n    BookRepository.new.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'can create a new book' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      fill_in 'Title',  with: 'New book'\n      fill_in 'Author', with: 'Some author'\n\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n    assert page.has_content?('New book')\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLaying The Foundations For A Form\n    \nBy now, we should be familiar with the working of actions, views and templates.\n\nWe'll speed things up a little, so we can quickly get to the good parts.\nFirst, create a new action for our \"New Book\" page:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#new\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\n\n\nThe interesting bit will be our new template, because we'll be using Hanami's form builder to construct a HTML form around our Book entity.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Form Helpers\n    \nLet's use form helpers to build this form in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb:\n# apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb\n<h2>Add book</h2>\n\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :title\n      text_field :title\n    end\n\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :author\n      text_field :author\n    end\n\n    div class: 'controls' do\n      submit 'Create Book'\n    end\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe've added <label> tags for our form fields, and wrapped each field in a\ncontainer <div> using Hanami's HTML builder helper.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSubmitting Our Form\n    \nTo submit our form, we need yet another action.\nLet's create a Books::Create action:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#create\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books', to: 'books#create'\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImplementing Create Action\n    \nOur books#create action needs to do two things.\nLet's express them as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'creates a new book' do\n    action.call(params)\n    book = repository.last\n\n    book.id.wont_be_nil\n    book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n  end\n\n  it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n\n    response[0].must_equal 302\n    response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n  end\nend\n\n\nLet's make these tests pass!\nWe've already seen how we can write entities to our database, and we can use redirect_to to implement our redirection:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n      redirect_to '/books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis minimal implementation should suffice to make our tests pass.\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 63592\n\n# Running:\n\n...S.S.........\n\nFinished in 0.081961s, 183.0142 runs/s, 305.0236 assertions/s.\n\n15 runs, 23 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 2 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\n            \n      \n      \nSecuring Our Form With Validations\n    \nHold your horses! We need some extra measures to build a truly robust form.\nImagine what would happen if the user were to submit the form without entering any values?\n\nWe could fill our database with bad data or see an exception for data integrity violations.\nWe clearly need a way of keeping invalid data out of our system!\n\nTo express our validations in a test, we need to wonder: what would happen if our validations failed?\nOne option would be to re-render the books#new form, so we can give our users another shot at completing it correctly.\nLet's specify this behaviour as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  describe 'with valid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n\n    it 'creates a book' do\n      action.call(params)\n      book = repository.last\n\n      book.id.wont_be_nil\n      book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n    end\n\n    it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n\n      response[0].must_equal 302\n      response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'with invalid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: {}] }\n\n    it 'returns HTTP client error' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n      response[0].must_equal 422\n    end\n\n    it 'dumps errors in params' do\n      action.call(params)\n      errors = action.params.errors\n\n      errors.dig(:book, :title).must_equal  ['is missing']\n      errors.dig(:book, :author).must_equal ['is missing']\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow our tests specify two alternative scenarios: our original happy path, and a new scenario in which validations fail.\nTo make our tests pass, we need to implement validations.\n\nAlthough you can add validation rules to the entity, Hanami also allows you to define validation rules as close to the source of the input as possible, i.e. the action.\nHanami controller actions can use the params class method to define acceptable incoming parameters.\n\nThis approach both whitelists what params are used (others are discarded to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities from untrusted user input) and adds rules to define what values are acceptable â€” in this case we've specified that the nested attributes for a book's title and author should be present.\n\nWith our validations in place, we can limit our entity creation and redirection to cases where the incoming params are valid:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :book\n\n    params do\n      required(:book).schema do\n        required(:title).filled(:str?)\n        required(:author).filled(:str?)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      if params.valid?\n        @book = BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n        redirect_to '/books'\n      else\n        self.status = 422\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhen the params are valid, the Book is created and the action redirects to a different URL.\nBut when the params are not valid, what happens?\n\nFirst, the HTTP status code is set to\n422 (Unprocessable Entity).\nThen the control will pass to the corresponding view, which needs to know which template to render.\nIn this case apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb will be used to render the form again.\n# apps/web/views/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::View\n    template 'books/new'\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis approach will work nicely because Hanami's form builder is smart enough to inspect the params in this action and populate the form fields with values found in the params.\nIf the user fills in only one field before submitting, they are presented with their original input, saving them the frustration of typing it again.\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Validation Errors\n    \nRather than just shoving the user a form under their nose when something has gone wrong, we should give them a hint of what's expected of them. Let's adapt our form to show a notice about invalid fields.\n\nFirst, we expect a list of errors to be included in the page when params contains errors:\n# spec/web/views/books/new_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::New do\n  let(:params)    { OpenStruct.new(valid?: false, error_messages: ['Title must be filled', 'Author must be filled']) }\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[params: params] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::New.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    rendered.must_include('There was a problem with your submission')\n    rendered.must_include('Title must be filled')\n    rendered.must_include('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe should also update our feature spec to reflect this new behavior:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  # Spec written earlier omitted for brevity\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n\n    assert page.has_content?('There was a problem with your submission')\n    assert page.has_content?('Title must be filled')\n    assert page.has_content?('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn our template we can loop over params.errors (if there are any) and display a friendly message.\nOpen up apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb and add the following at the top of the file:\n<% unless params.valid? %>\n  <div class=\"errors\">\n    <h3>There was a problem with your submission</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <% params.error_messages.each do |message| %>\n        <li><%= message %></li>\n      <% end %>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n<% end %>\n\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59940\n\n# Running:\n\n......S..........\n\nFinished in 0.188950s, 89.9707 runs/s, 179.9413 assertions/s.\n\n17 runs, 34 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImproving Our Use Of The Router\n    \nThe last improvement we are going to make, is in the use of our router.\nOpen up the routes file for the \"web\" application:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books',    to: 'books#create'\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\nget '/books',     to: 'books#index'\nroot              to: 'home#index'\n\n\nHanami provides a convenient helper method to build these REST-style routes, that we can use to simplify our router a bit:\nroot to: 'home#index'\nresources :books, only: [:index, :new, :create]\n\n\nTo get a sense of what routes are defined, now we've made this change, you can\nrun bundle exec hanami routes on your command-line to inspect the end result:\n% bundle exec hanami routes\n     Name Method     Path                           Action\n\n     root GET, HEAD  /                              Web::Controllers::Home::Index\n    books GET, HEAD  /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Index\n new_book GET, HEAD  /books/new                     Web::Controllers::Books::New\n    books POST       /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Create\n\n\nThe output shows you the name of the defined helper method (you can suffix this name with _path or _url and call it on the routes helper), the allowed HTTP method, the path and finally the controller action that will be used to handle the request.\n\nNow we've applied the resources helper method, we can take advantage of the named route methods.\nRemember how we built our form using form_for in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb?\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe don't need to include a hard-coded path in our template, when our router is already perfectly aware of which route to point the form to.\nWe can use the routes helper method that is available in our views and actions to access route-specific helper methods:\n<%=\n  form_for :book, routes.books_path do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe can make a similar change in apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb:\nredirect_to routes.books_path\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWrapping Up\n    \nCongratulations for completing your first Hanami project!\n\nLet's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.\n\nWe've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore.\nExplore the other guides, the Hanami API documentation, read the source code and follow the blog.\n\nAbove all, enjoy

sources or when we use a CDN, we can run into errors because our browser refute to load assets due to security restrictions (aka \"Content Security Policy\").\n\nTo fix them, we need to adjust security settings in our application.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      # ...\n\n      # If we're using our own CDN\n

just Ruby modules, we can create our own helpers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we need (for some reason) a helper that shuffles the characters of a string and we want it to

convention between the file name and the name of the module.\n  We can define this code, where and how we want.\n\n\nThen let's add that directory to the load paths of the application, so it can be eagerly loaded.\nAs third step, we include the module in all the views.

Hanami offers a security mechanism based on a technique called: Synchronizer Token Pattern.\n\nWhen we enable sessions, it uses them to store a random token for each user.\nForms are rendered with a special hidden field (_csrf_token) which contains this token.\n\nOn form submission, Hanami matches this input with the value from the session. If they match, the request can continue. If not, it resets the session and raises an exception.\n\nDevelopers can customize attack handling.\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested fields\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for :address do\n      text_field :city\n    end\n\n    submit 'Create'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[address][city]\" id=\"delivery-address-city\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested collections\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for_collection :addresses do\n      text_field :street\n    end\n\n  submit 'Create'\nend\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" method=\"POST\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"delivery-form\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"920cd5bfaecc6e58368950e790f2f7b4e5561eeeab230aa1b7de1b1f40ea7d5d\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-0-street\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-1-street\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAutomatic values\n    \nForm fields are automatically filled with the right value. Hanami looks up for explicit values passed in the form constructor and for the params of the current request. It compares the form hierarchy (including nested fields), with these two sources. For each match, it fills the associated value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we want to update data for delivery. We have two objects: delivery and customer, which are plain objects (no ORM involved). They respond to the following methods:\ndelivery.id   # => 1\ndelivery.code # => 123\n\ncustomer.name # => \"Luca\"\n\ncustomer.address.class # => Address\ncustomer.address.city  # => \"Rome\"\n\n\nLet's compose the form.\n<%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.delivery_path(id: delivery.id), method: :patch, values: {delivery: delivery, customer: customer} do\n    text_field :code\n\n    fields_for :customer do\n      text_field :name\n\n      fields_for :address do\n        text_field :city\n      end\n    end\n\n    submit 'Update'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"123\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n\nPlease note the :values option that we pass to #form_for. It maps the name attributes that we have in the form with the objects that we want to use to fill the values. For instance delivery[code] corresponds to delivery.code (123), delivery[customer][address][city] to customer.address.city (\"Rome\") and so on..\n\n            \n      \n      \nRead Values From Params\n    \nParams are automatically passed to form helpers, to read values and try to autofill fields. If a value is present both in params and explicit values (:values), the first takes precendence. The reason is simple: params sometimes represent a failed form submission attempt.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine the form described above, and that our user enters \"foo\" as delivery code. This value isn't acceptable for our model domain rules, so we render again the form, presenting a validation error. Our params are now carrying on the values filled by our user. For instance: params.get('delivery.code') returns \"foo\".\n\nHere how the form is rendered:\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"foo\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/helpers/forms/"},"214":{"title":"Guides - HTML5 Helpers","content":"      \n      \n      \nHTML5 Helpers\n    \nThis helper makes available an HTML5 generator that is template engine independent.\nIt's a private method for views and layouts called #html.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsage\n    \nThis is how it will look used with a layout:\nmodule Web::Views\n  class ApplicationLayout\n    include Web::Layout\n\n    def sidebar\n      html.aside(id: 'sidebar') do\n        div 'hello'\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n<%= sidebar %>\n\n\nIt generates:\n<aside id=\"sidebar\">\n  <div>hello</div>\n</aside>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFeatures\n    \n\nIt knows how to close tags according to HTML5 spec (1)\nIt accepts content as first argument (2)\nIt accepts builder as first argument (3)\nIt accepts content as block which returns a string (4)\nIt accepts content as a block with nested markup builders (5)\nIt builds attributes from given hash (6)\nit combines attributes and block (7)\n\n# 1\nhtml.div # => <div></div>\nhtml.img # => <img>\n\n# 2\nhtml.div('hello') # => <div>hello</div>\n\n# 3\nhtml.div(html.p('hello')) # => <div><p>hello</p></div>\n\n# 4\nhtml.div { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n# 5\nhtml.div do\n  p 'hello'\nend\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  <p>hello</p>\n#</div>\n\n# 6\nhtml.div('hello', id: 'el', 'data-x': 'y') # => <div id=\"el\" data-x=\"y\">hello</div>\n\n# 7\nhtml.div(id: 'yay') { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div id=\"yay\">\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n\nIt supports complex markup constructs, without the need of concatenate tags.

for remote SMTP installations)\nTest (:test, for testing purposes)\n\n\nIt defaults to SMTP (:smtp) for production environment, while :test is automatically set for development and test.\n\nThe second optional argument is a set of arbitrary configurations that we want to pass to the configuration:\n# config/environment.rb\n# ...\nHanami.configure do\n  # ...\n\n  mailer do\n    root Hanami.root.join(\"lib\", \"bookshelf\", \"mailers\")\n\n    # See http://hanamirb.org/guides/1.1/mailers/delivery\n    delivery :test\n  end\n\n  # ...\n\n  environment :production do\n    # ...\n\n    mailer do\n      delivery :smtp, address: ENV['SMTP_HOST'], port: ENV['SMTP_PORT']\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nFor advanced configurations, please have a look at mail gem by Mikel Lindsaar.\nAt the low level, Hanami::Mailer uses this rock solid library.\n\nBecause Hanami uses mail gem, which is a de facto standard for Ruby, we can have interoperability with all the most common gateways vendors.\nSendgrid, Mandrill, Postmark and Mailgun just to name a few, use SMTP and have detailed setup guides.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom Methods\n    \nIf we need to a custom delivery workflow, we can pass a class to the configuration.\n\nHere's an example on how to use Mandrill API to deliver emails.\n# config/environment.rb\n# ...\nrequire 'lib/mailers/mandrill_delivery_method'\n\nHanami.configure do\n  # ...\n\n  environment :production do\n    # ...\n\n    mailer do\n      delivery MandrillDeliveryMethod, api_key: ENV['MANDRILL_API_KEY']\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe object MUST respond to #initialize(options = {}) and to #deliver!(mail), where mail is an instance of Mail::Message.\nclass MandrillDeliveryMethod\n  def initialize(options)\n    @api_key = options.fetch(:api_key)\n  end\n\n  def deliver!(mail)\n    send convert(mail)\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def send(message)\n    gateway.messages.send message\n  end\n\n  def convert(mail)\n    # Convert a Mail::Message instance into a Hash structure\n    # See https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.ruby.html\n  end\n\n  def gateway\n    Mandrill::API.new(@api_key)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n  Please notice that this is only an example that illustrates custom policies.

It's just a matter of stubbing this method.\nIf we change the storage, the callers aren't affected.\n\n\n\n  \n    Hanami queries are based on gems from ROM project, namely\n    rom-repository and rom-sql.\n    The gem rom-sql is itself based on Sequel project.\n  \n  \n    Learn more on how to craft queries with\n    ROM\n    and Sequel.\n  \n\n\n            \n      \n      \nTimestamps\n    \nTo have a track of when a record has been created or updated is important when running a project in production.\n\nWhen creating a new table, if we add the following columns, a repository will take care of keeping the values updated.\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  up do\n    create_table :books do\n      # ...\n      column :created_at, DateTime\n      column :updated_at, DateTime\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nrepository = BookRepository.new\n\nbook = repository.create(title: \"Hanami\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\n\nbook = repository.update(book.id, title: \"Hanami Book\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:22:40 UTC\n\n\n\n  When a database table has created_at and updated_at timestamps, a repository will automatically update their values.\n\n\n\n  Timestamps are on UTC timezone.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLegacy Databases\n    \nBy default, a repository performs auto-mapping of corresponding database table and creates an automatic schema for the associated entity.\n\nWhen working with legacy databases we can resolve the naming mismatch between the table name, the columns, with repositories defaults and entities attributes.\n\nLet's say we have a database table like this:\nCREATE TABLE t_operator (\n    operator_id integer NOT NULL,\n    s_name text\n);\n\n\nWe can setup our repository with the following code:\n# lib/bookshelf/repositories/operator_repository.rb\nclass OperatorRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  self.relation = :t_operator\n\n  mapping do\n    attribute :id,   from: :operator_id\n    attribute :name, from: :s_name\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhile the entity can stay with the basic setup:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/operator.rb\nclass Operator < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe entity now gets the mapping we defined in the repository:\noperator = Operator.new(name: \"Jane\")\noperator.name # => \"Jane\"\n\n\nThe repository can use the same mapped attributes:\noperator = OperatorRepository.new.create(name: \"Jane\")\n  # => #<Operator:0x007f8e43cbcea0 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>\"Jane\"}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCount\n    \nCount is a concept not generally available to all the databases. SQL databases have it, but others don't.\n\nYou can define a method, if you're using a SQL database:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def count\n    books.count\n  end\nend\n\n\nOr you can expose specific conditions:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def on_sale_count\n    books.where(on_sale: true).count\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf you want to use raw SQL you can do:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def old_books_count\n    books.read(\"SELECT id FROM books WHERE created_at < (NOW() - 1 * interval '1 year')\").count\n  end\nend\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/repositories/overview/"},"238":{"title":"Guides - Repositories: PostgreSQL","content":"      \n      \n      \nPostgreSQL\n    \nHanami natively supports PostgreSQL data types.\n\nPlease check your PostgreSQL version for the available features.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUUID\n    \nHere's how to use UUID for a column:\n# db/migrations/20161113184557_create_projects.rb\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  up do\n    execute 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\"'\n\n    create_table :projects do\n      primary_key :id\n      column :name,  String\n      column :token, 'uuid'\n    end\n  end\n\n  down do\n    drop_table :projects\n    execute 'DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\"'\n  end\nend\n\nrequire \"securerandom\"\n\nProjectRepository.new.create(name: \"Hanami\", token: SecureRandom.uuid)\n  # => #<Project:0x007fbbc78f0a40 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>\"Hanami\", :token=>\"0aa7ecff-15e4-4aa4-8c00-0e699e2c66f0\"}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nUUID as Primary Key\n    Hanami::Model.migration do\n  up do\n    execute 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\"'\n\n    create_table :project_files do\n      primary_key :id, 'uuid', null: false, default: Hanami::Model::Sql.function(:uuid_generate_v4)\n      column :name, String\n    end\n  end\n\n  down do\n    drop_table :project_files\n    execute 'DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\"'\n  end\nend\n\nProjectFileRepository.new.create(name: \"source.rb\")\n  # => #<ProjectFile:0x007ff29c4b9740 @attributes={:id=>\"239f8e0f-d764-4a76-aaa7-7b59b5301c72\", :name=>\"source.rb\"}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nArray\n    Hanami::Model.migration do\n  change do\n    create_table :articles do\n      primary_key :id\n      column :title, String\n      column :tags, \"text[]\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nArticleRepository.new.create(title: \"Announcing Hanami 1.0\", tags: [\"announcements\"])\n  # => #<Article:0x007ffe1a5d9da8 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Announcing Hanami 1.0\", :tags=>[\"announcements\"]}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nJSON(B)\n    Hanami::Model.migration do\n  change do\n    create_table :commits do\n      primary_key       :id\n      column :metadata, \"jsonb\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nCommitRepository.new.create(metadata: { sha: \"8775b81\" })\n  # => #<Commit:0x007f8573dcbbf8 @attributes={:id=>1, :metadata=>{:sha=>\"8775b81\"}}>\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/repositories/postgresql/"},"239":{"title":"Guides -

We can express this concept with two methods in our validations: required (which we already met in previous examples), and optional.\nrequire 'hanami/validations'\n\nclass Signup\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email)    { ... }\n    optional(:referral) { ... }\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nType Safety\n    \nAt this point, we need to explicitly tell something really important about built-in predicates. Each of them have expectations about the methods that an input is able to respond to.\n\nWhy this is so important? Because if we try to invoke a method on the input weâ€™ll get a NoMethodError if the input doesnâ€™t respond to it. Which isnâ€™t nice, right?\n\nBefore to use a predicate, we want to ensure that the input is an instance of the expected type. Letâ€™s introduce another new predicate for our need: #type?.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) & gteq?(18) }\n\n\nIt takes the input and tries to coerce it. If it fails, the execution stops. If it succeed, the subsequent predicates can trust #type? and be sure that the input is an integer.\n\nWe suggest to use #type? at the beginning of the validations block. This type safety policy is crucial to prevent runtime errors.\n\nHanami::Validations supports the most common Ruby types:\n\n\nArray (aliased as array?)\nBigDecimal (aliased as decimal?)\nBoolean (aliased as bool?)\nDate (aliased as date?)\nDateTime (aliased as date_time?)\nFloat (aliased as float?)\nHash (aliased as hash?)\nInteger (aliased as int?)\nString (aliased as str?)\nTime (aliased as time?)\n\n\nFor each supported type, there a convenient predicate that acts as an alias. For instance, the two lines of code below are equivalent.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) }\nrequired(:age) { int? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMacros\n    \nRule composition with blocks is powerful, but it can become verbose.\nTo reduce verbosity, Hanami::Validations offers convenient macros that are internally expanded (aka interpreted) to an equivalent block expression\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nTo use when we expect a value to be filled:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? }\n\nrequired(:age).filled\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?)\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) & gt?(18) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n\n\nIn the examples above age is always required as value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaybe\n    \nTo use when a value can be nil:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { none? | int? }\n\nrequired(:age).maybe(:int?)\n\n\nIn the example above age can be nil, but if we send the value, it must be an integer.\n\n            \n      \n      \nEach\n    \nTo use when we want to apply the same validation rules to all the elements of an array:\n# expands to\n# required(:tags) { array? { each { str? } } }\n\nrequired(:tags).each(:str?)\n\n\nIn the example above tags must be an array of strings.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfirmation\n    \nThis is designed to check if pairs of web form fields have the same value. One wildly popular example is password confirmation.\nrequired(:password).filled.confirmation\n\n\nIt is valid if the input has password and password_confirmation keys with the same exact value.\n\nâš  CONVENTION: For a given key password, the confirmation predicate expects another key password_confirmation. Easy to tell, itâ€™s the concatenation of the original key with the _confirmation suffix. Their values must be equal. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nForms\n    \nAn important precondition to check before to implement a validator is about the expected input.\nWhen we use validators for already preprocessed data it's safe to use basic validations from Hanami::Validations mixin.\n\nIf the data is coming directly from user input via a HTTP form, it's advisable to use Hanami::Validations::Form instead.\nThe two mixins have the same API, but the latter is able to do low level input preprocessing specific for forms. For instance, blank inputs are casted to nil in order to avoid blank strings in the database.\n\n            \n      \n      \nRules\n    \nPredicates and macros are tools to code validations that concern a single key like first_name or email.\nIf the outcome of a validation depends on two or more attributes we can use rules.\n\nHere's a practical example: a job board.\nWe want to validate the form of the job creation with some mandatory fields: type (full time, part-time, contract), title (eg. Developer), description, company (just the name) and a website (which is optional).\nAn user must specify the location: on-site or remote. If it's on site, they must specify the location, otherwise they have to tick the checkbox for remote.\n\nHere's the code:\nclass CreateJob\n  include Hanami::Validations::Form\n\n  validations do\n    required(:type).filled(:int?, included_in?: [1, 2, 3])\n\n    optional(:location).maybe(:str?)\n    optional(:remote).maybe(:bool?)\n\n    required(:title).filled(:str?)\n    required(:description).filled(:str?)\n    required(:company).filled(:str?)\n\n    optional(:website).filled(:str?, format?: URI.regexp(%w(http https)))\n\n    rule(location_presence: [:location, :remote]) do |location, remote|\n      (remote.none? | remote.false?).then(location.filled?) &\n        remote.true?.then(location.none?)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify a rule with rule method, which takes an arbitrary name and an array of preconditions.\nOnly if :location and :remote are valid according to their validations described above, the rule block is evaluated.\n\nThe block yields the same exact keys that we put in the precondintions.\nSo for [:location, :remote] it will yield the corresponding values, bound to the location and remote variables.\n\nWe can use these variables to define the rule. We covered a few cases:\n\n\nIf remote is missing or false, then location must be filled\nIf remote is true, then location must be omitted\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested Input Data\n    \nWhile weâ€™re building complex web forms, we may find comfortable to organise data in a hierarchy of cohesive input fields. For instance, all the fields related to a customer, may have the customer prefix. To reflect this arrangement on the server side, we can group keys.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:name)  { â€¦ }\n    # other validations â€¦\n  end\nend\n\n\nGroups can be deeply nested, without any limitation.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    # other validations â€¦\n\n    required(:address).schema do\n      required(:street) { â€¦ }\n      # other address validations â€¦\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nComposition\n    \nUntil now, we have seen only small snippets to show specific features. That really close view prevents us to see the big picture of complex real world projects.\n\nAs the code base grows, itâ€™s a good practice to DRY validation rules.\nclass AddressValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:street) { â€¦ }\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis validator can be reused by other validators.\nclass CustomerValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:address).schema(AddressValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nAgain, there is no limit to the nesting levels.\nclass OrderValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:number) { â€¦ }\n    required(:customer).schema(CustomerValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn the end, OrderValidator is able to validate a complex data structure like this:\n{\n  number: \"123\",\n  customer: {\n    email: \"user@example.com\",\n    address: {\n      city: \"Rome\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWhitelisting\n    \nAnother fundamental role that validators plays in the architecture of our projects is input whitelisting.\nFor security reasons, we want to allow known keys to come in and reject everything else.\n\nThis process happens when we invoke #validate.\nAllowed keys are the ones defined with .required.\n\nPlease note that whitelisting is only available for Hanami::Validations::Form mixin.\n\n            \n      \n      \nResult\n    \nWhen we trigger the validation process with #validate, we get a result object in return. Itâ€™s able to tell if itâ€™s successful, which rules the input data has violated and an output data bag.\nresult = OrderValidator.new({}).validate\nresult.success? # => false\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMessages\n    \nresult.messages returns a nested set of validation error messages.\n\nEach error carries on informations about a single rule violation.\nresult.messages.fetch(:number)   # => [\"is missing\"]\nresult.messages.fetch(:customer) # => [\"is missing\"]\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nOutput\n    \nresult.output is a Hash which is the result of whitelisting and coercions. Itâ€™s useful to pass it do other components that may want to persist that data.\n{\n  \"number\"  => \"123\",\n  \"unknown\" => \"foo\"\n}\n\n\nIf we receive the input above, output will look like this.\nresult.output\n  # => { :number => 123 }\n\n\nWe can observe that:\n\n\nKeys are symbolized\nOnly whitelisted keys are included\nData is coerced\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nError Messages\n    \nTo pick the right error message is crucial for user experience.\nAs usual Hanami::Validations comes to the rescue for most common cases and it leaves space to customization of behaviors.\n\nWe have seen that builtin predicates have default messages, while inline predicates allow to specify a custom message via the :message option.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  predicate :email?, message: 'must be an email' do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?               # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:email) # => ['must be an email']\nresult.messages.fetch(:age)   # => ['must be greater than 18']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfigurable Error Messages\n    \nInline error messages are ideal for quick and dirty development, but we suggest to use an external YAML file to configure these messages:\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n\nTo be used like this:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n\n  predicate :email? do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom Error Messages\n    \nIn the example above, the failure message for age is fine: \"must be greater than 18\", but how to tweak it? What if we need to change into something diffent? Again, we can use the YAML configuration file for our purpose.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n    rules:\n      signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\nNow our validator is able to look at the right error message.\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?             # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:age) # => ['must be an adult']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom namespace\n    \nâš  CONVENTION: For a given validator named SignupValidator, the framework will look for signup translation key. âš \n\nIf for some reason that doesn't work for us, we can customize the namespace:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n  namespace     :my_signup\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nThe new namespace should be used in the YAML file too.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  # ...\n    rules:\n      my_signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInternationalization (I18n)\n    \nIf your project already depends on i18n gem, Hanami::Validations is able to look at the translations defined for that gem and to use them.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages :i18n\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n# config/locales/en.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    signup:\n      # ...\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/validations/advanced-usage/"},"251":{"title":"Guides - Boolean Logic","content":"      \n      \n      \nBoolean Logic\n    \nWhen we check data, we expect only two outcomes: an input can be valid or not. No grey areas, nor fuzzy results. Itâ€™s white or black, 1 or 0, true or false and boolean logic is the perfect tool to express these two states. Indeed, a Ruby boolean expression can only return true or false.\n\nTo better recognise the pattern, letâ€™s get back to the example above. This time we will map the natural language rules with programming language rules.\nrequired(:name) { filled? & str? & size? (3..64) }\n\n\nNow, I hope youâ€™ll never format code like that, but in this case, that formatting serves well our purpose to show how Rubyâ€™s  simplicity helps to define complex rules with no effort.\n\nFrom a high level perspective, we can tell that input data for name is valid only if all the requirements are satisfied. Thatâ€™s because we used &.\n\n            \n      \n      \nLogic Operators\n    \nWe support four logic operators:\n\n\n& (aliased as and) for conjunction\n| (aliased as or) for disjunction\n> (aliased as then) for implication\n^ (aliased as xor) for exclusive disjunction\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nContext Of Execution\n    \nPlease notice that we used & over Ruby's && keyword.\nThat's because the context of execution of these validations isn't a plain lambda, but something richer.\n\nFor real world projects, we want to support common scenarios without the need of reinventing the wheel ourselves. Scenarios like password confirmation, size check are already prepackaged with Hanami::Validations.\n\nâš  For this reason, we don't allow any arbitrary Ruby code to be executed, but only well defined predicates. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nPredicates\n    \nTo meet our needs, Hanami::Validations has an extensive collection of built-in predicates. A predicate is the expression of a business requirement (e.g. size greater than). The chain of several predicates determines if input data is valid or not.\n\nWe already met filled? and size?, now letâ€™s introduce the rest of them. They capture common use cases with web forms.\n\n            \n      \n      \nArray\n    \nIt checks if the the given value is an array, and iterates through its elements to perform checks on each of them.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { each { int? } } }\n\n\nThis example checks if codes is an array and if all the elements are integers, whereas the following example checks there are a minimum of 2 elements and all elements are strings.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { min_size?(2) & each { str? } } }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEmptiness\n    \nIt checks if the given value is empty or not. It is designed to works with strings and collections (array and hash).\nrequired(:tags) { empty? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEquality\n    \nThis predicate tests if the input is equal to a given value.\nrequired(:magic_number) { eql?(23) }\n\n\nRuby types are respected: 23 (an integer) is only equal to 23, and not to \"23\" (a string). See Type Safety section.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExclusion\n    \nIt checks if the input is not included by a given collection. This collection can be an array, a set, a range or any object that responds to #include?.\nrequired(:genre) { excluded_from?(%w(pop dance)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFormat\n    \nThis is a predicate that works with a regular expression to match it against data input.\nrequire 'uri'\nHTTP_FORMAT = URI.regexp(%w(http https))\n\nrequired(:url) { format?(HTTP_FORMAT) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than\n    \nThis predicate works with numbers to check if input is greater than a given threshold.\nrequired(:age) { gt?(18) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than Equal\n    \nThis is an open boundary variation of gt?. It checks if an input is greater than or equal of a given number.\nrequired(:age) { gteq?(19) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInclusion\n    \nThis predicate is the opposite of #exclude?: it verifies if the input is included in the given collection.\nrequired(:genre) { included_in?(%w(rock folk)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than\n    \nThis is the complement of #gt?: it checks for less than numbers.\nrequired(:age) { lt?(7) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than Equal\n    \nSimilarly to #gteq?, this is the open bounded version of #lt?: an input is valid if itâ€™s less than or equal to a number.\nrequired(:age) { lteq?(6) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nItâ€™s a predicate that ensures data input is filled, that means not nil or blank (\"\") or empty (in case we expect a collection).\nrequired(:name) { filled? }      # string\nrequired(:languages) { filled? } # collection\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMinimum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at least of the specified value.\nrequired(:password) { min_size?(12) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaximum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at max of the specified value.\nrequired(:name) { max_size?(128) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNone\n    \nThis verifies if the given input is nil.

Until now we have seen strings and arrays being analysed by this validation, but there is another interesting usage: files.\n\nWhen a user uploads a file, the web server sets an instance of Tempfile, which responds to #size. That means we can validate the weight in bytes of file uploads.\nMEGABYTE = 1024 ** 2\n\nrequired(:avatar) { size?(1..(5 * MEGABYTE)) }\n\n","url":"/guides/1.1/validations/boolean-logic/"},"252":{"title":"Guides - Custom Predicates","content":"      \n      \n      \nCustom Predicates\n    \nWe have seen that built-in predicates as an expressive tool to get our job done with common use cases.\n\nBut what if our case is not common?

For example, layout :application corresponds to Web::Views::ApplicationLayout.\n\n\nIf we want to disable a layout for a view, we can use a DSL for that:\n# apps/web/views/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n    layout false\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we want to turn off this feature entirely, we can set layout nil into the application's configuration.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Multiple Template Layouts\n    \nSometimes it's useful to have more than one layout.\nFor example, if the application.html.erb template contains navigation elements, and we want an entirely different layout, without navigation elements, for a login page, we can create a login.html.erb layout template.\n\nAssuming we have a Web::Actions::UserSessions::New action to log a user in, we can create a login.html.erb template right next to the default application.html.erb in apps/web/templates/.\n\nThen we need to create a new Web::Views::LoginLayout class, which will use the new layout template. This file can be named app/web/views/login_layout.rb(right next to the default application_layout.rb):\nmodule Web\n  module Views\n    class LoginLayout\n      include Web::Layout\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow, in our app/web/views/user_sessions/new.rb we can specify you'd like to use the login layout for this View:\nmodule Web::Views::UserSessions\n  class New\n    include Web::View\n    layout :login\n  end\nend\n\n\nAnd we can add layout :login to any other View in this app that should use this same layout.\n\n            \n      \n      \nOptional Content\n    \nSometimes it's useful to render content only on certain pages.\nFor example, this could be used to have page-specific javascript.\n\nGiven the following template for a layout:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <!-- ... -->\n  <body>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <footer>\n      <%= local :javascript %>\n    </footer>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nWith following views:\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\nand\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Show\n    include Web::View\n\n    def javascript\n      raw %(<script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script>)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe first view doesn't respond to #javascript, so it safely ignores it.\nOur second object (Web::Views::Books::Show) responds to that method, so the result will be included in the final markup.\n","url":"/guides/1.1/views/layouts/"},"257":{"title":"Guides - MIME Types","content":"      \n      \n      \nMIME Types\n    \nA view can handle several MIME Types.

If you have a controller name like Web::Controllers::Web then some code across your app will break with errors about constants not being found, for example in views which include Web::Layout. This is because Ruby starts constant lookup with the current module, so a constant like Web::Layout referenced by code in the Web::Controllers::Web or Web::Controllers::Web::MyAction module will be converted to Web::Controllers::Web::Layout, which can't be found and causes a constant lookup error.\n\n\n\n  If you absolutely must name a controller with the same name as your application, you'll need to explicitly set the namespace lookup for things which should be included from immediately under the app, not the controller by prefixing those names with ::, e.g. change your views to include ::Web::Layout instead of include Web::Layout, and using include ::Web::Action in your controllers.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nÂ Action Module\n    \nHanami philosophy emphasizes composition over inheritance and avoids the framework superclass antipattern.\nFor this reason, all the components are provided as modules to include instead of base classes to inherit from.\n\nLike we said before, Hanami can run multiple apps within the same Ruby process.\nEach of them has its own configuration.\nTo keep separated actions from an application named Web and an application named Admin, we include Web::Action and Admin::Action respectively.\n\nIn our example, we have a directive include Web::Action.\nThat means our action will behave according to the configuration of the Web application.\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the action mixin to include is Web::Action.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nWhen we include Web::Action, we made our object compliant with Hanami::Controller's actions.\nWe need to implement #call, which is a method that accepts only one argument: params.\nThat is the object that carries the payload that comes from incoming HTTP requests from the router.\n\nThis interface reminds us of Rack.\nIndeed, our action is compatible with the Rack protocol.\n","url":"/guides/actions/overview/"},"271":{"title":"Guides - Action Parameters","content":"      \n      \n      \nParameters\n    \nParameters are taken from the Rack env and passed as an argument to #call.\nThey are similar to a Ruby Hash, but they offer an expanded set of features.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nParams can come from:\n\n\nRouter variables (eg. /books/:id)\nQuery string (eg. /books?title=Hanami)\nRequest body (eg. a POST request to /books)\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAccess\n    \nTo access the value of a param, we can use the subscriber operator #[].\n# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      self.body = \"Query string: #{ params[:q] }\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we visit /dashboard?q=foo, we should see Query string: foo.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSymbol Access\n    \nParams and nested params can be referenced only via symbols.\nparams[:q]\nparams[:book][:title]\n\n\nNow, what happens if the parameter :book is missing from the request?\nBecause params[:book] is nil, we can't access :title.\nIn this case Ruby will raise a NoMethodError.\n\nWe have a safe solution for our problem: #get.\nIt accepts a list of symbols, where each symbol represents a level in our nested structure.\nparams.get(:book, :title)             #

...\n      body_parsers :json\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow params.get(:book, :title) returns \"Hanami\".\n\nIn case there is no suitable body parser for your format in Hanami, it is possible to declare a new one:\n# lib/foo_parser.rb\nclass FooParser\n  def mime_types\n    ['application/foo']\n  end\n\n  def parse(body)\n    # manually parse body\n  end\nend\n\n\nand subsequently register it:\n# apps/web/application.rb\n# ...\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      # ...\n      body_parsers FooParser.new\n      #

We pass them as a Hash and they are transformed into an instance of Hanami::Action::Params.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nExposures\n    \nThere are cases where we want to verify the internal state of an action.\nImagine we have a classic user profile page, like depicted in the example above.\nThe action asks for a record that corresponds to the given id, and then set a @user instance variable.\nHow do we verify that the record is the one that we are looking for?\n\nBecause we want to make @user available to the outside world, we're going to use an exposure.\nThey are used to pass a data payload between an action and the corresponding view.\nWhen we do expose :user, Hanami creates a getter (#user), so we can easily assert if the record is the right one.\n# apps/web/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include Web::Action\n    expose :user, :foo\n\n    def call(params)\n      @user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])\n      @foo  = 'bar'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe have used two exposures: :user and :foo, let's verify if they are properly set.\n# spec/web/controllers/users/show_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/show'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Users::Show do\n  before do\n    @user = UserRepository.new.create(name: 'Luca')\n  end\n\n  let(:action)  { Web::Controllers::Users::Show.new }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: @user.id)\n\n    response[0].must_equal 200\n\n    action.user.must_equal @user\n    action.exposures.must_equal({user: @user, foo: 'bar'})\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nThe internal state of an action can be easily verified with exposures.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nDependency Injection\n    \nDuring unit testing, we may want to use mocks to make tests faster or to avoid hitting external systems like databases, file system or remote services.\nBecause we can instantiate actions during tests, there is no need to use testing antipatterns (eg. any_instance_of, or UserRepository.new.stub(:find)).\nInstead, we can just specify which collaborators we want to use via dependency injection.\n\nLet's rewrite the test above so that it does not hit the database.\nWe're going to use RSpec for this example as it has a nicer API for mocks (doubles).\n# spec/web/controllers/users/show_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/show'\n\nRSpec.describe Web::Controllers::Users::Show do\n  let(:action)     { Web::Controllers::Users::Show.new(repository: repository) }\n  let(:user)       { User.new(id: 23, name: 'Luca') }\n  let(:repository) { double('repository', find: user) }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: user.id)\n\n    expect(response[0]).to      eq 200\n    expect(action.user).to      eq user\n    expect(action.exposures).to eq({user: user})\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe have injected the repository dependency which is a mock in our case.\nHere how to adapt our action.\n# apps/web/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include Web::Action\n    expose :user\n\n    def initialize(repository: UserRepository.new)\n      @repository = repository\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      @user = @repository.find(params[:id])\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nPlease be careful using doubles in unit tests. Always verify that the mocks are in a true representation of the corresponding production code.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFlash messages\n    \nIn your action tests, you can check flash messages too. For this, you can use exposures method for getting all flash data.\n\nThe following test example uses this method.\n# spec/web/controllers/users/create_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\nrequire_relative '../../../../apps/web/controllers/users/create'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Users::Create do\n  let(:action)  { Web::Controllers::Users::Create.new }\n  let(:user_params) { name: 'Luca' }\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    response = action.call(id: user_params)\n    flash = action.exposures[:flash]\n\n    flash[:info].must_equal 'User was successfully created'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nRequests Tests\n    \nUnit tests are a great tool to assert that low level interfaces work as expected.\nWe always advise combining them with integration tests.\n\nIn the case of Hanami web applications, we can write features (aka acceptance tests) with Capybara, but what do we use when we are building HTTP APIs?\nThe tool that we suggest is rack-test.\n\nImagine we have an API application mounted at /api/v1 in our Hanami::Container.\n# config/environment.rb\n# ...\nHanami::Container.configure do\n  mount ApiV1::Application, at: '/api/v1'\n  mount Web::Application,   at: '/'\nend\n\n\nThen we have the following action.\n# apps/api_v1/controllers/users/show.rb\nmodule ApiV1::Controllers::Users\n  class Show\n    include ApiV1::Action\n    accept :json\n\n    def call(params)\n      user = UserRepository.new.find(params[:id])\n      self.body = JSON.generate(user.to_h)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn this case we don't care too much about the internal state of the action, but about the output visible to the external world.\nThis is why we haven't set user as an instance variable and why we haven't exposed it.\n# spec/api_v1/requests/users_spec.rb\nrequire 'spec_helper'\n\ndescribe \"API V1 users\" do\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\n\n  before do\n    @user = UserRepository.new.create(name: 'Luca')\n  end\n\n  # app is required by Rack::Test\n  def app\n    Hanami.app\n  end\n\n  it \"is successful\" do\n    get \"/api/v1/users/#{ @user.id }\"\n\n    last_response.must_be :ok?\n    last_response.body.must_equal(JSON.generate(@user.to_h))\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nPlease avoid test doubles when writing full integration tests, as we want to verify that the whole stack is behaving as expected.\n\n","url":"/guides/actions/testing/"},"277":{"title":"Guides -

Then when we edit the source file, the destination file becomes stale.\nGET /assets/application.js\n# edit the original file: apps/web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n# then require it again\nGET /assets/application.js\n\n\nIt copies the source into the destination file again (public/assets/application.js) and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrecompiled Asset\n    \nLet's say we use Sass to write our stylesheets.\nGET /assets/application.css\n\n\nIt preprocess the apps/web/assets/stylesheet/application.css.sass to public/assets/application.css and then serves it.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDynamic Resource\n    GET /books/23\n\n\nThis isn't a static file available under public/, so the control passes to the backend that hits the appropriate action.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMissing Resource\n    GET /unknown\n\n\nThis isn't a static file or a dynamic resource, the project returns a 404 (Not Found).\n\n            \n      \n      \nSources\n    \nEach application has a separated set of directories where its assets can be found.\nAssets are recursively searched under these paths.\n\nNew projects have a default directory where application assets can be put:\n% tree apps/web/assets\napps/web/assets\nâ”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico\nâ”œâ”€â”€ images\nâ”œâ”€â”€ javascripts\nâ””â”€â”€ stylesheets\n\n3 directories, 1 file\n\n\nWe can add as many directories we want under it (eg. apps/web/assets/fonts).\n\n\n  For a given application named Web, the default asset directory is apps/web/assets\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAdding Sources\n    \nIf we want to add other sources for a given application, we can specify them in the configuration.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      # ...\n      assets do\n        # apps/web/assets is added by default\n        sources << [\n          'vendor/assets'\n        ]\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis will add apps/web/vendor/assets and all its subdirectories.\n\n\n  Hanami looks recursively through the asset sources. In order to NOT accidentally disclose sensitive files like secrets or source code, please make sure that these sources directories ONLY contain web assets.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nThird Party Gems\n    \nHanami allows developers to use Rubygems as a way to distribute web assets and make them available to Hanami applications.\n\nThird party gems can be maintained by developers who want to bring frontend framework support to Hanami.\nLet's say we want to build an hanami-emberjs gem.\n% tree .\n# ...\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hanami\nâ”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ emberjs\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ dist\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ember.js\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ember.min.js\nâ”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ version.rb\nâ”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ emberjs.rb\nâ”œâ”€â”€ hanami-emberjs.gemspec\n# ...\n\n\nWe put only the assets that we want to serve in an arbitrary directory.\nThen we add it to Hanami::Assets.sources.\n# lib/hanami/emberjs.rb\nrequire 'hanami/assets'\n\nmodule Hanami\n  module Emberjs\n    require 'hanami/emberjs/version'\n  end\nend\n\nHanami::Assets.sources << __dir__ + '/emberjs/source'\n\n\nWhen an application requires 'hanami/emberjs', that directory will be added to the sources where Hanami can search for assets.\n<%= javascript 'ember' %>\n\n\nThen we can use the javascript helper to include ember.js in our application.\n","url":"/guides/assets/overview/"},"281":{"title":"Guides - Assets Preprocessors","content":"      \n      \n      \nAssets\n    \n            \n      \n      \nPreprocessors\n    \nHanami is able to run assets preprocessors and lazily compile them under public/assets.\n\nImagine to have application.css.scss in apps/web/assets/stylesheets and reset.css under\napps/web/vendor/stylesheets.\n\nThe extensions structure is important.\nThe first one is mandatory and it's used to understand which asset type we are\nhandling: .css for stylesheets.\nThe second one is optional and it's for a preprocessor: .scss for Sass.\n\n\n  For a given asset application.css.scss, the last extension (.scss) is used to determine the right preprocessor.\n\n\n\n  Preprocessors are optional, an application can work with plain javascripts or stylesheets.

If you're reading this page, it's very likely that you want to learn more about Hanami.\n    That's great, congrats! If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable web applications, you're in good hands.\n  \n\n  \n    Hanami is built for people like you.\n  \n\n  \n    I warn you that whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer this learning process can be hard.\n    Over time, we build expectations about how things should be, and it can be painful to change. But without change, there is no challenge and without challenge, there is no growth.\n  \n\n  \n    Sometimes a feature doesn't look right, that doesn't mean it's you.\n    It can be a matter of formed habits, a design fallacy or even a bug.\n  \n\n  \n    Myself and the rest of the Community are putting best efforts to make Hanami better every day.\n  \n\n  \n    In this guide we will set up our first Hanami project and build a simple bookshelf web application.\n    We'll touch on all the major components of Hanami framework, all guided by tests.\n  \n\n  \n    If you feel alone, or frustrated, don't give up, jump in our chat and ask for help.\n    There will be someone more than happy to talk with you.\n  \n\n  \n    Enjoy,\n    Luca Guidi\n    Hanami creator\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrerequisites\n    \nBefore we get started, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.\nFirst, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.\n\nYou should also be familiar with Bundler, Rake, working with a terminal and building apps using the Model, View, Controller paradigm.\n\nLastly, in this guide we'll be using a SQLite database.\nIf you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.\n\n            \n      \n      \nCreate a New Hanami Project\n    \nTo create a new Hanami project, we need to install the Hanami gem from Rubygems.\nThen we can use the new hanami executable to generate a new project:\n% gem install hanami\n% hanami new bookshelf\n\n\n\n  By default, the project will be setup to use a SQLite database. For real-world projects, you can specify your engine:\n  \n  % hanami new bookshelf --database=postgres\n Â \n\n\nThis will create a new directory bookshelf in our current location.\nLet's see what it contains:\n% cd bookshelf\n% tree -L 1\n.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ Rakefile\nâ”œâ”€â”€ apps\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config\nâ”œâ”€â”€ config.ru\nâ”œâ”€â”€ db\nâ”œâ”€â”€ lib\nâ”œâ”€â”€ public\nâ””â”€â”€ spec\n\n6 directories, 3 files\n\n\nHere's what we need to know:\n\n\nGemfile defines our Rubygems dependencies (using Bundler).\nRakefile describes our Rake tasks.\napps contains one or more web applications compatible with Rack.\nHere we can find the first generated Hanami application called Web.\nIt's the place where we find our controllers, views, routes and templates.\nconfig contains configuration files.\nconfig.ru is for Rack servers.\ndb contains our database schema and migrations.\nlib contains our business logic and domain model, including entities and repositories.\npublic will contain compiled static assets.\nspec contains our tests.\n\n\nGo ahead and install our gem dependency with Bundler; then we can launch a development server:\n% bundle install\n% bundle exec hanami server\n\n\nAnd... bask in the glory of your first Hanami project at\nhttp://localhost:2300! We should see a screen similar to this:\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Architecture\n    \nHanami architecture can host several Hanami (and Rack) applications in the same Ruby process.\n\nThese applications live under apps/.\nEach of them can be a component of our product, such as the user facing web interface, the admin pane, metrics, HTTP API etc..\n\nAll these parts are a delivery mechanism to the business logic that lives under lib/.\nThis is the place where our models are defined, and interact with each other to compose the features that our product provides.\n\nHanami architecture is heavily inspired by Clean Architecture.\n\n            \n      \n      \nWriting Our First Test\n    \nThe opening screen we see when we point our browser at our app, is a\ndefault page which is displayed when there are no routes defined.\n\nHanami encourages Behavior Driven Development (BDD) as a way to write web applications.\nIn order to get our first custom page to display, we'll write a high-level feature test:\n# spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Visit home' do\n  it 'is successful' do\n    visit '/'\n\n    page.body.must_include('Bookshelf')\n  end\nend\n\n\nNote that, although Hanami is ready for a Behavior Driven Development workflow out of the box, it is in no way bound to any particular testing framework -- nor does it come with special integrations or libraries.\n\nWe'll go with Minitest here (which is the default), but we can use RSpec by creating the project with --test=rspec option.\nHanami will then generate helpers and stub files for it.\n\n\n  Please check .env.test in case you need to tweak the database URL.\n\n\nWe have to migrate our schema in the test database by running:\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\nAs you can see, we have set HANAMI_ENV environment variable to instruct our command about the environment to use.\n\n            \n      \n      \nFollowing a Request\n    \nNow we have a test, we can see it fail:\n% bundle exec rake test\nRun options: --seed 44759\n\n# Running:\n\nF\n\nFinished in 0.018611s, 53.7305 runs/s, 53.7305 assertions/s.\n\n  1) Failure:\nHomepage#test_0001_is successful [/Users/hanami/bookshelf/spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb:6]:\nExpected \"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n  <head>\\n    <title>Not Found</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <h1>Not Found</h1>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n\" to include \"Bookshelf\".\n\n1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\nNow let's make it pass.\nLets add the code required to make this test pass, step-by-step.\n\nThe first thing we need to add is a route:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nroot to: 'home#index'\n\n\nWe pointed our application's root URL to the index action of the home controller (see the routing guide for more information).\nNow we can create the index action.\n# apps/web/controllers/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis is an empty action that doesn't implement any business logic.\nEach action has a corresponding view, which is a Ruby object and needs to be added in order to complete the request.\n# apps/web/views/home/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Home\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\n...which, in turn, is empty and does nothing more than render its template.\nThis is the file we need to edit in order to make our test pass. All we need to do is add the bookshelf heading.\n# apps/web/templates/home/index.html.erb\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n\n\nSave your changes, run your test again and it now passes. Great!\nRun options: --seed 19286\n\n# Running:\n\n.\n\nFinished in 0.011854s, 84.3600 runs/s, 168.7200 assertions/s.\n\n1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGenerating New Actions\n    \nLet's use our new knowledge about the major Hanami components to add a new action.\nThe purpose of our Bookshelf project is to manage books.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and let the user manage them with our project.\nA first step would be to show a listing of all the books in our system.\n\nLet's write a new feature test describing what we want to achieve:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe test is simple enough, and fails because the URL /books is not currently recognised in our application. We'll create a new controller action to fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nHanami Generators\n    \nHanami ships with various generators to save on typing some of the code involved in adding new functionality.\nIn our terminal, enter:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#index\n\n\nThis will generate a new action index in the books controller of the web application.\nIt gives us an empty action, view and template; it also adds a default route to apps/web/config/routes.rb:\nget '/books', to: 'books#index'\n\n\nIf you're using ZSH, you may get zsh: no matches found: books#index. In that case, you can use:\n\n% hanami generate action web books/index\n\n\nTo make our test pass, we need to edit our newly generated template file in apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb:\n<h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<div id=\"books\">\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"book\">\n    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>\n    <p>by <strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\nSave your changes and see your tests pass! The output will also contain a skipped test. This is due to an autogenerated test in spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb.\n\nThe terminology of controllers and actions might be confusing, so let's clear this up: actions form the basis of our Hanami applications; controllers are mere modules that group several actions together.\nSo while the \"controller\" is conceptually present in our project, in practice we only deal with actions.\n\nWe've used a generator to create a new endpoint in our application.\nBut one thing you may have noticed is that our new template contains the same <h1> as our home/index.html.erb template.\nLet's fix that.\n\n            \n      \n      \nLayouts\n    \nTo avoid repeating ourselves in every single template, we can use a layout.\nOpen up the file apps/web/templates/application.html.erb and edit it to look like this:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Bookshelf</title>\n    <%= favicon %>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Bookshelf</h1>\n    <%= yield %>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nNow you can remove the duplicate lines from the other templates. Let's run the tests again to check that everything worked fine:\nbundle exec rake test\n\n\nA layout is like any other template, but it is used to wrap your regular templates.\nThe yield line is replaced with the contents of our regular template.\nIt's the perfect place to put our repeating headers and footers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nModeling Our Data With Entities\n    \nHard-coding books in our templates is, admittedly, kind of cheating.\nLet's add some dynamic data to our application.\n\nWe'll store books in our database and display them on our page.\nTo do so, we need a way to read and write to our database.\nEnter entities and repositories:\n\n\nan entity is a domain object (eg. Book) uniquely identified by its identity.\na repository mediates between entities and the persistence layer.\n\n\nEntities are totally unaware of the database.\nThis makes them lightweight and easy to test.\n\nFor this reason we need a repository to persist the data that a Book depends on.\nRead more about entities and repositories in the models guide.\n\nHanami ships with a generator for models, so let's use it to create a Book entity and the corresponding repository:\n% bundle exec hanami generate model book\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\ncreate  lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb\ncreate  db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\ncreate  spec/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository_spec.rb\n\n\nThe generator gives us an entity, a repository, a migration, and accompanying test files.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMigrations To Change Our Database Schema\n    \nLet's modify the generated migration (the path to the migration will differ for you, because it contains a timestamp) to include title and author fields:\n# db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb\n\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  change do\n    create_table :books do\n      primary_key :id\n\n      column :title,  String, null: false\n      column :author, String, null: false\n\n      column :created_at, DateTime, null: false\n      column :updated_at, DateTime, null: false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nHanami provides a DSL to describe changes to our database schema. You can read more\nabout how migrations work in the migrations' guide.\n\nIn this case, we define a new table with columns for each of our entities' attributes.\nLet's prepare our database for the development and test environments:\n% bundle exec hanami db prepare\n% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWorking With Entities\n    \nAn entity is something really close to a plain Ruby object.\nWe should focus on the behaviors that we want from it and only then, how to save it.\n\nFor now, we keep the generated entity class:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb\nclass Book < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\nThis class will generate getters and setters for each attribute which we pass to initialize params.\nWe can verify it all works as expected with a unit test:\n# spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Book do\n  it 'can be initialized with attributes' do\n    book = Book.new(title: 'Refactoring')\n    book.title.must_equal 'Refactoring'\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Repositories\n    \nNow we are ready to play around with our repository.\nWe can use Hanami's console command to launch IRb with our application pre-loaded, so we can use our objects:\n% bundle exec hanami console\n>> repository = BookRepository.new\n=> => #<BookRepository relations=[:books]>\n>> repository.all\n=> []\n>> book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab61c23b8 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n>> repository.find(book.id)\n=> #<Book:0x007f9ab6181610 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"TDD\", :author=>\"Kent Beck\", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>\n\n\nHanami repositories have methods to load one or more entities from our database; and to create and update existing records.\nThe repository is also the place where you would define new methods to implement custom queries.\n\nTo recap, we've seen how Hanami uses entities and repositories to model our data.\nEntities represent our behavior, while repositories use mappings to translate our entities to our data store.\nWe can use migrations to apply changes to our database schema.\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Dynamic Data\n    \nWith our new experience modelling data, we can get to work displaying dynamic data on our book listing page.\nLet's adjust the feature test we created earlier:\n# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'List books' do\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    repository.create(title: 'PoEAA', author: 'Martin Fowler')\n    repository.create(title: 'TDD',   author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'displays each book on the page' do\n    visit '/books'\n\n    within '#books' do\n      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe create the required records in our test and then assert the correct number of book classes on the page.\nWhen we run this test it should pass. If it does not pass, a likely reason is that the test database was not migrated.\n\nNow we can go change our template and remove the static HTML.\nOur view needs to loop over all available records and render them.\nLet's write a test to force this change in our view:\n# spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::Index do\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[books: []] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::Index.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'exposes #books' do\n    view.books.must_equal exposures.fetch(:books)\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are no books' do\n    it 'shows a placeholder message' do\n      rendered.must_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'when there are books' do\n    let(:book1)     { Book.new(title: 'Refactoring', author: 'Martin Fowler') }\n    let(:book2)     { Book.new(title: 'Domain Driven Design', author: 'Eric Evans') }\n    let(:exposures) { Hash[books: [book1, book2]] }\n\n    it 'lists them all' do\n      rendered.scan(/class=\"book\"/).count.must_equal 2\n      rendered.must_include('Refactoring')\n      rendered.must_include('Domain Driven Design')\n    end\n\n    it 'hides the placeholder message' do\n      rendered.wont_include('<p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>')\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify that our index page will show a simple placeholder message when there are no books to display; when there are, it lists every one of them.\nNote how rendering a view with some data is relatively straight-forward.\nHanami is designed around simple objects with minimal interfaces that are easy to test in isolation, yet still work great together.\n\nLet's rewrite our template to implement these requirements:\n# apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb\n<h2>All books</h2>\n\n<% if books.any? %>\n  <div id=\"books\">\n    <% books.each do |book| %>\n      <div class=\"book\">\n        <h2><%= book.title %></h2>\n        <p><%= book.author %></p>\n      </div>\n    <% end %>\n  </div>\n<% else %>\n  <p class=\"placeholder\">There are no books yet.</p>\n<% end %>\n\n\nIf we run our feature test now, we'll see it fails â€” because our controller\naction does not actually expose the books to our view. We can write a test for\nthat change:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/index_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Index do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Index.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n\n    @book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')\n  end\n\n  it 'is successful' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n    response[0].must_equal 200\n  end\n\n  it 'exposes all books' do\n    action.call(params)\n    action.exposures[:books].must_equal [@book]\n  end\nend\n\n\nWriting tests for controller actions is basically two-fold: you either assert on the response object, which is a Rack-compatible array of status, headers and content; or on the action itself, which will contain exposures after we've called it.\nNow we've specified that the action exposes :books, we can implement our action:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/index.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :books\n\n    def call(params)\n      @books = BookRepository.new.all\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nBy using the expose method in our action class, we can expose the contents of our @books instance variable to the outside world, so that Hanami can pass it to the view.\nThat's enough to make all our tests pass again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59133\n\n# Running:\n\n.........\n\nFinished in 0.042065s, 213.9543 runs/s, 380.3633 assertions/s.\n\n9 runs, 16 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nBuilding Forms To Create Records\n    \nOne of the last remaining steps is to make it possible to add new books to the system.\nThe plan is simple: we build a page with a form to enter details.\n\nWhen the user submits the form, we build a new entity, save it, and redirect the user back to the book listing.\nHere's that story expressed in a test:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  after do\n    BookRepository.new.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'can create a new book' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      fill_in 'Title',  with: 'New book'\n      fill_in 'Author', with: 'Some author'\n\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n    assert page.has_content?('New book')\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLaying The Foundations For A Form\n    \nBy now, we should be familiar with the working of actions, views and templates.\n\nWe'll speed things up a little, so we can quickly get to the good parts.\nFirst, create a new action for our \"New Book\" page:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#new\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\n\n\nThe interesting bit will be our new template, because we'll be using Hanami's form builder to construct a HTML form around our Book entity.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Form Helpers\n    \nLet's use form helpers to build this form in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb:\n# apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb\n<h2>Add book</h2>\n\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :title\n      text_field :title\n    end\n\n    div class: 'input' do\n      label      :author\n      text_field :author\n    end\n\n    div class: 'controls' do\n      submit 'Create Book'\n    end\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe've added <label> tags for our form fields, and wrapped each field in a\ncontainer <div> using Hanami's HTML builder helper.\n\n            \n      \n      \nSubmitting Our Form\n    \nTo submit our form, we need yet another action.\nLet's create a Books::Create action:\n% bundle exec hanami generate action web books#create\n\n\nThis adds a new route to our app:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books', to: 'books#create'\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImplementing Create Action\n    \nOur books#create action needs to do two things.\nLet's express them as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  it 'creates a new book' do\n    action.call(params)\n    book = repository.last\n\n    book.id.wont_be_nil\n    book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n  end\n\n  it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n    response = action.call(params)\n\n    response[0].must_equal 302\n    response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n  end\nend\n\n\nLet's make these tests pass!\nWe've already seen how we can write entities to our database, and we can use redirect_to to implement our redirection:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    def call(params)\n      BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n      redirect_to '/books'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis minimal implementation should suffice to make our tests pass.\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 63592\n\n# Running:\n\n...S.S.........\n\nFinished in 0.081961s, 183.0142 runs/s, 305.0236 assertions/s.\n\n15 runs, 23 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 2 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\n            \n      \n      \nSecuring Our Form With Validations\n    \nHold your horses! We need some extra measures to build a truly robust form.\nImagine what would happen if the user were to submit the form without entering any values?\n\nWe could fill our database with bad data or see an exception for data integrity violations.\nWe clearly need a way of keeping invalid data out of our system!\n\nTo express our validations in a test, we need to wonder: what would happen if our validations failed?\nOne option would be to re-render the books#new form, so we can give our users another shot at completing it correctly.\nLet's specify this behaviour as unit tests:\n# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do\n  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }\n  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }\n\n  before do\n    repository.clear\n  end\n\n  describe 'with valid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }\n\n    it 'creates a book' do\n      action.call(params)\n      book = repository.last\n\n      book.id.wont_be_nil\n      book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)\n    end\n\n    it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n\n      response[0].must_equal 302\n      response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe 'with invalid params' do\n    let(:params) { Hash[book: {}] }\n\n    it 'returns HTTP client error' do\n      response = action.call(params)\n      response[0].must_equal 422\n    end\n\n    it 'dumps errors in params' do\n      action.call(params)\n      errors = action.params.errors\n\n      errors.dig(:book, :title).must_equal  ['is missing']\n      errors.dig(:book, :author).must_equal ['is missing']\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow our tests specify two alternative scenarios: our original happy path, and a new scenario in which validations fail.\nTo make our tests pass, we need to implement validations.\n\nAlthough you can add validation rules to the entity, Hanami also allows you to define validation rules as close to the source of the input as possible, i.e. the action.\nHanami controller actions can use the params class method to define acceptable incoming parameters.\n\nThis approach both whitelists what params are used (others are discarded to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities from untrusted user input) and adds rules to define what values are acceptable â€” in this case we've specified that the nested attributes for a book's title and author should be present.\n\nWith our validations in place, we can limit our entity creation and redirection to cases where the incoming params are valid:\n# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Controllers::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::Action\n\n    expose :book\n\n    params do\n      required(:book).schema do\n        required(:title).filled(:str?)\n        required(:author).filled(:str?)\n      end\n    end\n\n    def call(params)\n      if params.valid?\n        @book = BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])\n\n        redirect_to '/books'\n      else\n        self.status = 422\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhen the params are valid, the Book is created and the action redirects to a different URL.\nBut when the params are not valid, what happens?\n\nFirst, the HTTP status code is set to\n422 (Unprocessable Entity).\nThen the control will pass to the corresponding view, which needs to know which template to render.\nIn this case apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb will be used to render the form again.\n# apps/web/views/books/create.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Create\n    include Web::View\n    template 'books/new'\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis approach will work nicely because Hanami's form builder is smart enough to inspect the params in this action and populate the form fields with values found in the params.\nIf the user fills in only one field before submitting, they are presented with their original input, saving them the frustration of typing it again.\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n\n            \n      \n      \nDisplaying Validation Errors\n    \nRather than just shoving the user a form under their nose when something has gone wrong, we should give them a hint of what's expected of them. Let's adapt our form to show a notice about invalid fields.\n\nFirst, we expect a list of errors to be included in the page when params contains errors:\n# spec/web/views/books/new_spec.rb\nrequire_relative '../../../spec_helper'\n\ndescribe Web::Views::Books::New do\n  let(:params)    { OpenStruct.new(valid?: false, error_messages: ['Title must be filled', 'Author must be filled']) }\n  let(:exposures) { Hash[params: params] }\n  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb') }\n  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::New.new(template, exposures) }\n  let(:rendered)  { view.render }\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    rendered.must_include('There was a problem with your submission')\n    rendered.must_include('Title must be filled')\n    rendered.must_include('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe should also update our feature spec to reflect this new behavior:\n# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb\nrequire 'features_helper'\n\ndescribe 'Add a book' do\n  # Spec written earlier omitted for brevity\n\n  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do\n    visit '/books/new'\n\n    within 'form#book-form' do\n      click_button 'Create'\n    end\n\n    current_path.must_equal('/books')\n\n    assert page.has_content?('There was a problem with your submission')\n    assert page.has_content?('Title must be filled')\n    assert page.has_content?('Author must be filled')\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn our template we can loop over params.errors (if there are any) and display a friendly message.\nOpen up apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb and add the following at the top of the file:\n<% unless params.valid? %>\n  <div class=\"errors\">\n    <h3>There was a problem with your submission</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <% params.error_messages.each do |message| %>\n        <li><%= message %></li>\n      <% end %>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n<% end %>\n\n\nRun your tests again and see they are all passing again!\n% bundle exec rake\nRun options: --seed 59940\n\n# Running:\n\n......S..........\n\nFinished in 0.188950s, 89.9707 runs/s, 179.9413 assertions/s.\n\n17 runs, 34 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skips\n\nYou have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nImproving Our Use Of The Router\n    \nThe last improvement we are going to make, is in the use of our router.\nOpen up the routes file for the \"web\" application:\n# apps/web/config/routes.rb\npost '/books',    to: 'books#create'\nget '/books/new', to: 'books#new'\nget '/books',     to: 'books#index'\nroot              to: 'home#index'\n\n\nHanami provides a convenient helper method to build these REST-style routes, that we can use to simplify our router a bit:\nroot to: 'home#index'\nresources :books, only: [:index, :new, :create]\n\n\nTo get a sense of what routes are defined, now we've made this change, you can\nrun bundle exec hanami routes on your command-line to inspect the end result:\n% bundle exec hanami routes\n     Name Method     Path                           Action\n\n     root GET, HEAD  /                              Web::Controllers::Home::Index\n    books GET, HEAD  /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Index\n new_book GET, HEAD  /books/new                     Web::Controllers::Books::New\n    books POST       /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Create\n\n\nThe output shows you the name of the defined helper method (you can suffix this name with _path or _url and call it on the routes helper), the allowed HTTP method, the path and finally the controller action that will be used to handle the request.\n\nNow we've applied the resources helper method, we can take advantage of the named route methods.\nRemember how we built our form using form_for in apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb?\n<%=\n  form_for :book, '/books' do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe don't need to include a hard-coded path in our template, when our router is already perfectly aware of which route to point the form to.\nWe can use the routes helper method that is available in our views and actions to access route-specific helper methods:\n<%=\n  form_for :book, routes.books_path do\n    # ...\n  end\n%>\n\n\nWe can make a similar change in apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb:\nredirect_to routes.books_path\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWrapping Up\n    \nCongratulations for completing your first Hanami project!\n\nLet's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.\n\nWe've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore.\nExplore the other guides, the Hanami API documentation, read the source code and follow the blog.\n\nAbove all, enjoy

just Ruby modules, we can create our own helpers.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we need (for some reason) a helper that shuffles the characters of a string and we want it to be available in all our views.\n\nAs first thing, let's define the module.\n# app/web/helpers/shuffler.rb\nmodule Web\n  module Helpers\n    module Shuffler\n      private\n      SEPARATOR =

is NO convention between the file name and the name of the module.\n  We can define this code, where and how we want.\n\n\nThen let's add that directory to the load paths of the application, so it can be eagerly loaded.\nAs third step, we include the module in all the views.

Hanami offers a security mechanism based on a technique called: Synchronizer Token Pattern.\n\nWhen we enable sessions, it uses them to store a random token for each user.\nForms are rendered with a special hidden field (_csrf_token) which contains this token.\n\nOn form submission, Hanami matches this input with the value from the session. If they match, the request can continue. If not, it resets the session and raises an exception.\n\nDevelopers can customize attack handling.\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested fields\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for :address do\n      text_field :city\n    end\n\n    submit 'Create'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[address][city]\" id=\"delivery-address-city\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested collections\n    <%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.deliveries_path do\n    text_field :customer_name\n\n    fields_for_collection :addresses do\n      text_field :street\n    end\n\n  submit 'Create'\nend\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries\" method=\"POST\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"delivery-form\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"920cd5bfaecc6e58368950e790f2f7b4e5561eeeab230aa1b7de1b1f40ea7d5d\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer_name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-0-street\" value=\"\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[addresses][][street]\" id=\"delivery-address-1-street\" value=\"\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Create</button>\n</form>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nAutomatic values\n    \nForm fields are automatically filled with the right value. Hanami looks up for explicit values passed in the form constructor and for the params of the current request. It compares the form hierarchy (including nested fields), with these two sources. For each match, it fills the associated value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine we want to update data for delivery. We have two objects: delivery and customer, which are plain objects (no ORM involved). They respond to the following methods:\ndelivery.id   # => 1\ndelivery.code # => 123\n\ncustomer.name # => \"Luca\"\n\ncustomer.address.class # => Address\ncustomer.address.city  # => \"Rome\"\n\n\nLet's compose the form.\n<%=\n  form_for :delivery, routes.delivery_path(id: delivery.id), method: :patch, values: {delivery: delivery, customer: customer} do\n    text_field :code\n\n    fields_for :customer do\n      text_field :name\n\n      fields_for :address do\n        text_field :city\n      end\n    end\n\n    submit 'Update'\n  end\n%>\n\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"123\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n\nPlease note the :values option that we pass to #form_for. It maps the name attributes that we have in the form with the objects that we want to use to fill the values. For instance delivery[code] corresponds to delivery.code (123), delivery[customer][address][city] to customer.address.city (\"Rome\") and so on..\n\n            \n      \n      \nRead Values From Params\n    \nParams are automatically passed to form helpers, to read values and try to autofill fields. If a value is present both in params and explicit values (:values), the first takes precendence. The reason is simple: params sometimes represent a failed form submission attempt.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExample\n    \nImagine the form described above, and that our user enters \"foo\" as delivery code. This value isn't acceptable for our model domain rules, so we render again the form, presenting a validation error. Our params are now carrying on the values filled by our user. For instance: params.get('delivery.code') returns \"foo\".\n\nHere how the form is rendered:\n<form action=\"/deliveries/1\" id=\"delivery-form\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"PATCH\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_csrf_token\" value=\"4800d585b3a802682ae92cb72eed1cdd2894da106fb4e9e25f8a262b862c52ce\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[code]\" id=\"delivery-code\" value=\"foo\">\n\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][name]\" id=\"delivery-customer-name\" value=\"Luca\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"delivery[customer][address][city]\" id=\"delivery-customer-address-city\" value=\"Rome\">\n\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n\n","url":"/guides/helpers/forms/"},"296":{"title":"Guides - HTML5 Helpers","content":"      \n      \n      \nHTML5 Helpers\n    \nThis helper makes available an HTML5 generator that is template engine independent.\nIt's a private method for views and layouts called #html.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsage\n    \nThis is how it will look used with a layout:\nmodule Web::Views\n  class ApplicationLayout\n    include Web::Layout\n\n    def sidebar\n      html.aside(id: 'sidebar') do\n        div 'hello'\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n<%= sidebar %>\n\n\nIt generates:\n<aside id=\"sidebar\">\n  <div>hello</div>\n</aside>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFeatures\n    \n\nIt knows how to close tags according to HTML5 spec (1)\nIt accepts content as first argument (2)\nIt accepts builder as first argument (3)\nIt accepts content as block which returns a string (4)\nIt accepts content as a block with nested markup builders (5)\nIt builds attributes from given hash (6)\nit combines attributes and block (7)\n\n# 1\nhtml.div # => <div></div>\nhtml.img # => <img>\n\n# 2\nhtml.div('hello') # => <div>hello</div>\n\n# 3\nhtml.div(html.p('hello')) # => <div><p>hello</p></div>\n\n# 4\nhtml.div { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n# 5\nhtml.div do\n  p 'hello'\nend\n# =>\n#<div>\n#  <p>hello</p>\n#</div>\n\n# 6\nhtml.div('hello', id: 'el', 'data-x': 'y') # => <div id=\"el\" data-x=\"y\">hello</div>\n\n# 7\nhtml.div(id: 'yay') { 'hello' }\n# =>\n#<div id=\"yay\">\n#  hello\n#</div>\n\n\nIt supports complex markup constructs, without the need of concatenate tags.

Repositories","content":"      \n      \n      \nRepositories\n    \nAn object that mediates between entities and the persistence layer.\nIt offers a standardized API to query and execute commands on a database.\n\nA repository is storage independent, all the queries and commands are\ndelegated to the current adapter.\n\nThis architecture has several advantages:\n\n\nApplications depend on a standard API, instead of low level details\n(Dependency Inversion principle)\nApplications depend on a stable API, that doesn't change if the\nstorage changes\nDevelopers can postpone storage decisions\nConfines persistence logic to a low level\nMultiple data sources can easily coexist in an application\n\n\n\n  As of the current version, Hanami only supports SQL databases.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInterface\n    \nWhen a class inherits from Hanami::Repository, it will receive the following interface:\n\n\n#create(data) â€“ Create a record for the given data and return an entity\n#update(id, data) â€“ Update the record corresponding to the id and return the updated entity\n#delete(id) â€“ Delete the record corresponding to the given entity\n#all - Fetch all the entities from the collection\n#find(id) - Fetch an entity from the collection by its ID\n#first - Fetch the first entity from the collection\n#last  - Fetch the last entity from the collection\n#clear - Delete all the records from the collection\n\n\nA collection is a homogenous set of records.\nIt corresponds to a table for a SQL database or to a MongoDB collection.\nrepository = BookRepository.new\n\nbook = repository.create(title: \"Hanami\")\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cbd8b7c0 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC}>\n\nbook = repository.find(book.id)\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cbd5a030 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC}>\n\nbook = repository.update(book.id, title: \"Hanami Book\")\n  # => #<Book:0x007f95cb243408 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>\"Hanami Book\", :created_at=>2016-11-13 16:02:37 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-13 16:03:34 UTC}>\n\nrepository.delete(book.id)\n\nrepository.find(book.id)\n  # => nil\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSaving more than one record\n    \nFor saving bunch of records you need to define a #create_many command:\nclass BookRepository\n  def create_many(list)\n    command(:create, books, result: :many).call(list)\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow you can use #create_many as a bulk creation method:\nBookRepository.new.create_many([{ title: \"Hanami\" }, { title: \"Ruby\"}])\n# => [#<Book:0x007f95cbd8b7c0 @attributes={...}>, #<Book:0x007ff4e20e6f80 @attributes={...}>]\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nPrivate Queries\n    \nAll the queries are private.\nThis decision forces developers to define intention revealing API, instead of leaking storage API details outside of a repository.\n\nLook at the following code:\nBookRepository.new.where(author_id: 23).order(:published_at).limit(8)\n\n\nThis is bad for a variety of reasons:\n\n\nThe caller has an intimate knowledge of the internal mechanisms of the Repository.\nThe caller works on several levels of abstraction.\nIt doesn't express a clear intent, it's just a chain of methods.\nThe caller can't be easily tested in isolation.\nIf we change the storage, we are forced to change the code of the caller(s).\n\n\nThere is a better way:\n# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def most_recent_by_author(author, limit: 8)\n    books\n      .where(author_id: author.id)\n      .order(:published_at)\n      .limit(limit)\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis is a huge improvement, because:\n\n\nThe caller doesn't know how the repository fetches the entities.\nThe caller works on a single level of abstraction. It doesn't even know about records, only works with entities.\nIt expresses a clear intent.\nThe caller can be easily tested in isolation. It's just a matter of stubbing this method.\nIf we change the storage, the callers aren't affected.\n\n\n\n  \n    Hanami queries are based on gems from ROM project, namely\n    rom-repository and rom-sql.\n    The gem rom-sql is itself based on Sequel project.\n  \n  \n    Learn more on how to craft queries with\n    ROM\n    and Sequel.\n  \n\n\n            \n      \n      \nTimestamps\n    \nTo have a track of when a record has been created or updated is important when running a project in production.\n\nWhen creating a new table, if we add the following columns, a repository will take care of keeping the values updated.\nHanami::Model.migration do\n  up do\n    create_table :books do\n      # ...\n      column :created_at, DateTime\n      column :updated_at, DateTime\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nrepository = BookRepository.new\n\nbook = repository.create(title: \"Hanami\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\n\nbook = repository.update(book.id, title: \"Hanami Book\")\n\nbook.created_at # => 2016-11-14 08:20:44 UTC\nbook.updated_at # => 2016-11-14 08:22:40 UTC\n\n\n\n  When a database table has created_at and updated_at timestamps, a repository will automatically update their values.\n\n\n\n  Timestamps are on UTC timezone.\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLegacy Databases\n    \nBy default, a repository performs auto-mapping of corresponding database table and creates an automatic schema for the associated entity.\n\nWhen working with legacy databases we can resolve the naming mismatch between the table name, the columns, with repositories defaults and entities attributes.\n\nLet's say we have a database table like this:\nCREATE TABLE t_operator (\n    operator_id integer NOT NULL,\n    s_name text\n);\n\n\nWe can setup our repository with the following code:\n# lib/bookshelf/repositories/operator_repository.rb\nclass OperatorRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  self.relation = :t_operator\n\n  mapping do\n    attribute :id,   from: :operator_id\n    attribute :name, from: :s_name\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhile the entity can stay with the basic setup:\n# lib/bookshelf/entities/operator.rb\nclass Operator < Hanami::Entity\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe entity now gets the mapping we defined in the repository:\noperator = Operator.new(name: \"Jane\")\noperator.name # => \"Jane\"\n\n\nThe repository can use the same mapped attributes:\noperator = OperatorRepository.new.create(name: \"Jane\")\n  # => #<Operator:0x007f8e43cbcea0 @attributes={:id=>1, :name=>\"Jane\"}>\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCount\n    \nCount is a concept not generally available to all the databases. SQL databases have it, but others don't.\n\nYou can define a method, if you're using a SQL database:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def count\n    books.count\n  end\nend\n\n\nOr you can expose specific conditions:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def on_sale_count\n    books.where(on_sale: true).count\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf you want to use raw SQL you can do:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def old_books_count\n    books.read(\"SELECT id FROM books WHERE created_at < (NOW() - 1 * interval '1 year')\").count\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nRetrieving the first and last records\n    \nA repository provides default #first and #lastÂ methods, but they don't have any sorting policy.\n\nIf you need to specify a custom sorting policy you can use #order:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  # ...\n\n  def newest_book\n    books.order { created_at }.limit(1).one\n    # Passing a symbol instead works too: books.order(:created_at).one\n  end\n\n  def oldest_book\n    books.order { created_at.desc }.limit(1).one\n  end\nend\n\n\nWhen #one is used if no record is find, it returns nil.\n\nPlease remember to always use limit(1), otherwise #one will raise an exception.\n\nYou can read more in this issue.\n","url":"/guides/models/repositories/"},"318":{"title":"Guides - SQL Queries","content":"      \n      \n      \nSort\n    \nYou can sort records using #order:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def from_first_to_last\n    users.order { created_at.asc }\n  end\n\n  def from_last_to_first\n    users.order { created_at.desc }\n  end\n\n  def alphabetical\n    users.order { name.asc }\n  end\n\n  def alphabetical_reverse\n    users.order { name.asc }\n  end\n\n  def sort_via_other_relation\n    users.order(books[:title].qualified.asc)\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLimit\n    \nYou can use #limit to limit the number of records fetched from the database:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def last_created(number)\n    users.order { created_at.desc }.limit(number)\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSQL Functions\n    \nYou can use any SQL functions like ILIKE, IN, NOT, LENGTH, etc..\nThese functions are available as Ruby methods inside the #where block:\nclass UserRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  def by_name(name)\n    users.where { name.ilike(\"%?%\", name) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_in(input)\n    users.where { id.in(input) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_in_range(range)\n    users.where { id.in(range) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_min_max(min, max)\n    users.where { id > min || id < max }\n  end\n\n  def by_not_id(input)\n    users.where { id.not(input) }\n  end\n\n  def by_id_not_in_range(range)\n    users.where { id.not(1..100) }\n  end\n\n  def by_name_length(input)\n    users.where { length(:name) > input }\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nJoins\n    \nYou can join several relations:\nclass BookRepository < Hanami::Repository\n  associations do\n    has_many :comments\n  end\n\n  def commented_within(date_range)\n    books\n      .join(comments)\n      .where(comments[:created_at].qualified => date_range)\n      .as(Book)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nFor a given relation named :books, the used foreign key in :comments is :book_id.

Subdomain\n    mount Blog.new, host: 'blog'\n\n\nAll the HTTP requests to http://blog.example.com will be routed to Blog.\n\n\n  In development, you will NOT be able to access http://blog.localhost:2300,\n  so you should specify a host when running the server:\n  bundle exec hanami server --host=lvh.me.\n  Then your application can be visited at

We can express this concept with two methods in our validations: required (which we already met in previous examples), and optional.\nrequire 'hanami/validations'\n\nclass Signup\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email)    { ... }\n    optional(:referral) { ... }\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nType Safety\n    \nAt this point, we need to explicitly tell something really important about built-in predicates. Each of them have expectations about the methods that an input is able to respond to.\n\nWhy this is so important? Because if we try to invoke a method on the input weâ€™ll get a NoMethodError if the input doesnâ€™t respond to it. Which isnâ€™t nice, right?\n\nBefore to use a predicate, we want to ensure that the input is an instance of the expected type. Letâ€™s introduce another new predicate for our need: #type?.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) & gteq?(18) }\n\n\nIt takes the input and tries to coerce it. If it fails, the execution stops. If it succeed, the subsequent predicates can trust #type? and be sure that the input is an integer.\n\nWe suggest to use #type? at the beginning of the validations block. This type safety policy is crucial to prevent runtime errors.\n\nHanami::Validations supports the most common Ruby types:\n\n\nArray (aliased as array?)\nBigDecimal (aliased as decimal?)\nBoolean (aliased as bool?)\nDate (aliased as date?)\nDateTime (aliased as date_time?)\nFloat (aliased as float?)\nHash (aliased as hash?)\nInteger (aliased as int?)\nString (aliased as str?)\nTime (aliased as time?)\n\n\nFor each supported type, there a convenient predicate that acts as an alias. For instance, the two lines of code below are equivalent.\nrequired(:age) { type?(Integer) }\nrequired(:age) { int? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMacros\n    \nRule composition with blocks is powerful, but it can become verbose.\nTo reduce verbosity, Hanami::Validations offers convenient macros that are internally expanded (aka interpreted) to an equivalent block expression\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nTo use when we expect a value to be filled:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? }\n\nrequired(:age).filled\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?)\n\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { filled? & type?(Integer) & gt?(18) }\n\nrequired(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n\n\nIn the examples above age is always required as value.\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaybe\n    \nTo use when a value can be nil:\n# expands to\n# required(:age) { none? | int? }\n\nrequired(:age).maybe(:int?)\n\n\nIn the example above age can be nil, but if we send the value, it must be an integer.\n\n            \n      \n      \nEach\n    \nTo use when we want to apply the same validation rules to all the elements of an array:\n# expands to\n# required(:tags) { array? { each { str? } } }\n\nrequired(:tags).each(:str?)\n\n\nIn the example above tags must be an array of strings.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfirmation\n    \nThis is designed to check if pairs of web form fields have the same value. One wildly popular example is password confirmation.\nrequired(:password).filled.confirmation\n\n\nIt is valid if the input has password and password_confirmation keys with the same exact value.\n\nâš  CONVENTION: For a given key password, the confirmation predicate expects another key password_confirmation. Easy to tell, itâ€™s the concatenation of the original key with the _confirmation suffix. Their values must be equal. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nForms\n    \nAn important precondition to check before to implement a validator is about the expected input.\nWhen we use validators for already preprocessed data it's safe to use basic validations from Hanami::Validations mixin.\n\nIf the data is coming directly from user input via a HTTP form, it's advisable to use Hanami::Validations::Form instead.\nThe two mixins have the same API, but the latter is able to do low level input preprocessing specific for forms. For instance, blank inputs are casted to nil in order to avoid blank strings in the database.\n\n            \n      \n      \nRules\n    \nPredicates and macros are tools to code validations that concern a single key like first_name or email.\nIf the outcome of a validation depends on two or more attributes we can use rules.\n\nHere's a practical example: a job board.\nWe want to validate the form of the job creation with some mandatory fields: type (full time, part-time, contract), title (eg. Developer), description, company (just the name) and a website (which is optional).\nAn user must specify the location: on-site or remote. If it's on site, they must specify the location, otherwise they have to tick the checkbox for remote.\n\nHere's the code:\nclass CreateJob\n  include Hanami::Validations::Form\n\n  validations do\n    required(:type).filled(:int?, included_in?: [1, 2, 3])\n\n    optional(:location).maybe(:str?)\n    optional(:remote).maybe(:bool?)\n\n    required(:title).filled(:str?)\n    required(:description).filled(:str?)\n    required(:company).filled(:str?)\n\n    optional(:website).filled(:str?, format?: URI.regexp(%w(http https)))\n\n    rule(location_presence: [:location, :remote]) do |location, remote|\n      (remote.none? | remote.false?).then(location.filled?) &\n        remote.true?.then(location.none?)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nWe specify a rule with rule method, which takes an arbitrary name and an array of preconditions.\nOnly if :location and :remote are valid according to their validations described above, the rule block is evaluated.\n\nThe block yields the same exact keys that we put in the precondintions.\nSo for [:location, :remote] it will yield the corresponding values, bound to the location and remote variables.\n\nWe can use these variables to define the rule. We covered a few cases:\n\n\nIf remote is missing or false, then location must be filled\nIf remote is true, then location must be omitted\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNested Input Data\n    \nWhile weâ€™re building complex web forms, we may find comfortable to organise data in a hierarchy of cohesive input fields. For instance, all the fields related to a customer, may have the customer prefix. To reflect this arrangement on the server side, we can group keys.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:name)  { â€¦ }\n    # other validations â€¦\n  end\nend\n\n\nGroups can be deeply nested, without any limitation.\nvalidations do\n  required(:customer).schema do\n    # other validations â€¦\n\n    required(:address).schema do\n      required(:street) { â€¦ }\n      # other address validations â€¦\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nComposition\n    \nUntil now, we have seen only small snippets to show specific features. That really close view prevents us to see the big picture of complex real world projects.\n\nAs the code base grows, itâ€™s a good practice to DRY validation rules.\nclass AddressValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:street) { â€¦ }\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis validator can be reused by other validators.\nclass CustomerValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email) { â€¦ }\n    required(:address).schema(AddressValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nAgain, there is no limit to the nesting levels.\nclass OrderValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  validations do\n    required(:number) { â€¦ }\n    required(:customer).schema(CustomerValidator)\n  end\nend\n\n\nIn the end, OrderValidator is able to validate a complex data structure like this:\n{\n  number: \"123\",\n  customer: {\n    email: \"user@example.com\",\n    address: {\n      city: \"Rome\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nWhitelisting\n    \nAnother fundamental role that validators plays in the architecture of our projects is input whitelisting.\nFor security reasons, we want to allow known keys to come in and reject everything else.\n\nThis process happens when we invoke #validate.\nAllowed keys are the ones defined with .required.\n\nPlease note that whitelisting is only available for Hanami::Validations::Form mixin.\n\n            \n      \n      \nResult\n    \nWhen we trigger the validation process with #validate, we get a result object in return. Itâ€™s able to tell if itâ€™s successful, which rules the input data has violated and an output data bag.\nresult = OrderValidator.new({}).validate\nresult.success? # => false\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMessages\n    \nresult.messages returns a nested set of validation error messages.\n\nEach error carries on informations about a single rule violation.\nresult.messages.fetch(:number)   # => [\"is missing\"]\nresult.messages.fetch(:customer) # => [\"is missing\"]\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nOutput\n    \nresult.output is a Hash which is the result of whitelisting and coercions. Itâ€™s useful to pass it do other components that may want to persist that data.\n{\n  \"number\"  => \"123\",\n  \"unknown\" => \"foo\"\n}\n\n\nIf we receive the input above, output will look like this.\nresult.output\n  # => { :number => 123 }\n\n\nWe can observe that:\n\n\nKeys are symbolized\nOnly whitelisted keys are included\nData is coerced\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nError Messages\n    \nTo pick the right error message is crucial for user experience.\nAs usual Hanami::Validations comes to the rescue for most common cases and it leaves space to customization of behaviors.\n\nWe have seen that builtin predicates have default messages, while inline predicates allow to specify a custom message via the :message option.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  predicate :email?, message: 'must be an email' do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?               # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:email) # => ['must be an email']\nresult.messages.fetch(:age)   # => ['must be greater than 18']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfigurable Error Messages\n    \nInline error messages are ideal for quick and dirty development, but we suggest to use an external YAML file to configure these messages:\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n\nTo be used like this:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n\n  predicate :email? do |current|\n    # ...\n  end\n\n  validations do\n    required(:email).filled(:str?, :email?)\n    required(:age).filled(:int?, gt?: 18)\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom Error Messages\n    \nIn the example above, the failure message for age is fine: \"must be greater than 18\", but how to tweak it? What if we need to change into something diffent? Again, we can use the YAML configuration file for our purpose.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    email?: \"must be an email\"\n\n    rules:\n      signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\nNow our validator is able to look at the right error message.\nresult = SignupValidator.new(email: 'foo', age: 1).validate\n\nresult.success?             # => false\nresult.messages.fetch(:age) # => ['must be an adult']\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nCustom namespace\n    \nâš  CONVENTION: For a given validator named SignupValidator, the framework will look for signup translation key. âš \n\nIf for some reason that doesn't work for us, we can customize the namespace:\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages_path 'config/messages.yml'\n  namespace     :my_signup\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nThe new namespace should be used in the YAML file too.\n# config/messages.yml\nen:\n  # ...\n    rules:\n      my_signup:\n        age:\n          gt?: \"must be an adult\"\n\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInternationalization (I18n)\n    \nIf your project already depends on i18n gem, Hanami::Validations is able to look at the translations defined for that gem and to use them.\nclass SignupValidator\n  include Hanami::Validations\n\n  messages :i18n\n\n  # ...\nend\n\n# config/locales/en.yml\nen:\n  errors:\n    signup:\n      # ...\n\n","url":"/guides/validations/advanced-usage/"},"335":{"title":"Guides - Boolean Logic","content":"      \n      \n      \nBoolean Logic\n    \nWhen we check data, we expect only two outcomes: an input can be valid or not. No grey areas, nor fuzzy results. Itâ€™s white or black, 1 or 0, true or false and boolean logic is the perfect tool to express these two states. Indeed, a Ruby boolean expression can only return true or false.\n\nTo better recognise the pattern, letâ€™s get back to the example above. This time we will map the natural language rules with programming language rules.\nrequired(:name) { filled? & str? & size? (3..64) }\n\n\nNow, I hope youâ€™ll never format code like that, but in this case, that formatting serves well our purpose to show how Rubyâ€™s  simplicity helps to define complex rules with no effort.\n\nFrom a high level perspective, we can tell that input data for name is valid only if all the requirements are satisfied.

Scenarios like password confirmation, size check are already prepackaged with Hanami::Validations.\n\nâš  For this reason, we don't allow any arbitrary Ruby code to be executed, but only well defined predicates. âš \n\n            \n      \n      \nPredicates\n    \nTo meet our needs, Hanami::Validations has an extensive collection of built-in predicates. A predicate is the expression of a business requirement (e.g. size greater than). The chain of several predicates determines if input data is valid or not.\n\nWe already met filled? and size?, now letâ€™s introduce the rest of them. They capture common use cases with web forms.\n\n            \n      \n      \nArray\n    \nIt checks if the the given value is an array, and iterates through its elements to perform checks on each of them.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { each { int? } } }\n\n\nThis example checks if codes is an array and if all the elements are integers, whereas the following example checks there are a minimum of 2 elements and all elements are strings.\nrequired(:codes) { array? { min_size?(2) & each { str? } } }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEmptiness\n    \nIt checks if the given value is empty or not. It is designed to works with strings and collections (array and hash).\nrequired(:tags) { empty? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nEquality\n    \nThis predicate tests if the input is equal to a given value.\nrequired(:magic_number) { eql?(23) }\n\n\nRuby types are respected: 23 (an integer) is only equal to 23, and not to \"23\" (a string). See Type Safety section.\n\n            \n      \n      \nExclusion\n    \nIt checks if the input is not included by a given collection. This collection can be an array, a set, a range or any object that responds to #include?.\nrequired(:genre) { excluded_from?(%w(pop dance)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFormat\n    \nThis is a predicate that works with a regular expression to match it against data input.\nrequire 'uri'\nHTTP_FORMAT = URI.regexp(%w(http https))\n\nrequired(:url) { format?(HTTP_FORMAT) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than\n    \nThis predicate works with numbers to check if input is greater than a given threshold.\nrequired(:age) { gt?(18) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nGreater Than Equal\n    \nThis is an open boundary variation of gt?. It checks if an input is greater than or equal of a given number.\nrequired(:age) { gteq?(19) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nInclusion\n    \nThis predicate is the opposite of #exclude?: it verifies if the input is included in the given collection.\nrequired(:genre) { included_in?(%w(rock folk)) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than\n    \nThis is the complement of #gt?: it checks for less than numbers.\nrequired(:age) { lt?(7) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nLess Than Equal\n    \nSimilarly to #gteq?, this is the open bounded version of #lt?: an input is valid if itâ€™s less than or equal to a number.\nrequired(:age) { lteq?(6) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nFilled\n    \nItâ€™s a predicate that ensures data input is filled, that means not nil or blank (\"\") or empty (in case we expect a collection).\nrequired(:name) { filled? }      # string\nrequired(:languages) { filled? } # collection\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMinimum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at least of the specified value.\nrequired(:password) { min_size?(12) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nMaximum Size\n    \nThis verifies that the size of the given input is at max of the specified value.\nrequired(:name) { max_size?(128) }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nNone\n    \nThis verifies if the given input is nil. Blank strings (\"\") wonâ€™t pass this test and return false.\nrequired(:location) { none? }\n\n\n            \n      \n      \nSize\n    \nIt checks if the size of input data is: a) exactly the same of a given quantity or b) it falls into a range.\nrequired(:two_factor_auth_code) { size?(6) }     # exact\nrequired(:password)             { size?(8..32) } # range\n\n\nThe check works with strings and collections.\nrequired(:answers) { size?(2) } # only 2 answers are allowed\n\n\nThis predicate works with objects that respond to #size. Until now we have seen strings and arrays being analysed by this validation, but there is another interesting usage: files.\n\nWhen a user uploads a file, the web server sets an instance of Tempfile, which responds to #size. That means we can validate the weight in bytes of file uploads.\nMEGABYTE = 1024 ** 2\n\nrequired(:avatar) { size?(1..(5 * MEGABYTE)) }\n\n","url":"/guides/validations/boolean-logic/"},"336":{"title":"Guides - Custom Predicates","content":"      \n      \n      \nCustom Predicates\n    \nWe have seen that built-in predicates as an expressive tool to get our job done with common use cases.\n\nBut what if our case is not common?

View Layouts","content":"      \n      \n      \nLayouts\n    \nLayouts are special views, that render the \"fixed\" part of the HTML markup.\nThis is the part that doesn't change from page to page (perhaps navigation, sidebar, header, footer, etc.)\n\nWhen we generate a new application, there is a default layout called Web::Views::ApplicationLayout with a apps/web/templates/application.html.erb template.\nIt comes with a very basic HTML5 wireframe.\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <%= yield %>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nThe most interesting part is <%= yield %>.\nIt's replaced at the runtime with the output of a view.\nThe order for rendering is first the view, and then the layout.\n\nThe context for a layout template is made of the layout and the current view.\nThe latter has higher priority.\n\nImagine having the following line <title><%= page_title %></title>.\nIf both the layout and the view implement page_title, Hanami will use the one from the view.\n\n            \n      \n      \nConfigure Layout\n    \nThe default layout is defined in an application's configuration.\n# apps/web/application.rb\nmodule Web\n  class Application < Hanami::Application\n    configure do\n      layout :application\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nHanami transforms the layout name in the application's configuration, by appending the Layout suffix. For example, layout :application corresponds to Web::Views::ApplicationLayout.\n\n\nIf we want to disable a layout for a view, we can use a DSL for that:\n# apps/web/views/dashboard/index.rb\nmodule Web::Views::Dashboard\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n    layout false\n  end\nend\n\n\nIf we want to turn off this feature entirely, we can set layout nil into the application's configuration.\n\n            \n      \n      \nUsing Multiple Template Layouts\n    \nSometimes it's useful to have more than one layout.\nFor example, if the application.html.erb template contains navigation elements, and we want an entirely different layout, without navigation elements, for a login page, we can create a login.html.erb layout template.\n\nAssuming we have a Web::Actions::UserSessions::New action to log a user in, we can create a login.html.erb template right next to the default application.html.erb in apps/web/templates/.\n\nThen we need to create a new Web::Views::LoginLayout class, which will use the new layout template. This file can be named app/web/views/login_layout.rb(right next to the default application_layout.rb):\nmodule Web\n  module Views\n    class LoginLayout\n      include Web::Layout\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow, in our app/web/views/user_sessions/new.rb we can specify you'd like to use the login layout for this View:\nmodule Web::Views::UserSessions\n  class New\n    include Web::View\n    layout :login\n  end\nend\n\n\nAnd we can add layout :login to any other View in this app that should use this same layout.\n\n            \n      \n      \nOptional Content\n    \nSometimes it's useful to render content only on certain pages.\nFor example, this could be used to have page-specific javascript.\n\nGiven the following template for a layout:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <!-- ... -->\n  <body>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <footer>\n      <%= local :javascript %>\n    </footer>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nWith following views:\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Index\n    include Web::View\n  end\nend\n\n\nand\nmodule Web::Views::Books\n  class Show\n    include Web::View\n\n    def javascript\n      raw %(<script src=\"/path/to/script.js\"></script>)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nThe first view doesn't respond to #javascript, so it safely ignores it.\nOur second object (Web::Views::Books::Show) responds to that method, so the result will be included in the final markup.\n","url":"/guides/views/layouts/"},"341":{"title":"Guides - MIME Types","content":"      \n      \n      \nMIME Types\n    \nA view can handle several MIME Types.
